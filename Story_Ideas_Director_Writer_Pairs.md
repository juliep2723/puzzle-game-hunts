Your friend's older sibling texts you - their sibling has been acting strange, talking about "other versions" of the mall.

The sibling explains: your friend discovered the mall exists in multiple universes, and something is wrong - the universes are mixing together. You need to solve puzzles to "align" the universes back to normal.
