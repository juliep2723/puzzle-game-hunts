# Story Beats - Production Guide
## Complete Beat-by-Beat Production Instructions

**Game Flow**: Cambridgeside Galleria Mall (various locations) → Food Court Celebration  
**Time**: ~60 minutes  
**Core Loop**: Maya asks → Players solve → Report back → Maya reveals → Next ask  
**Maya's Mechanic**: Collecting words from puzzles that form a phrase (revealed in Beat 6)

**Maya's Hinting Philosophy**: 
- Give very subtle hints first (location finding, general direction)
- Then subtle hints (what to look for, how to approach)
- Escalate only if players express frustration or demand answers
- Goal: Let players feel proud of solving, but don't let them get stuck
- Never give away answers unless explicitly frustrated

  [Maya, urgent, in Lex's workspace]
  "Lex was researching the mall for his music video when he found something 
  incredible - and terrible. In the 1980s, a prankster called The Foam Phantom 
  rigged the entire mall with a Rube Goldberg machine."
  
  [CUT TO: Simple Rube Goldberg demo - dominoes fall, ball rolls, mechanism triggers]
  
  [CUT BACK TO: Maya]
  "It was supposed to be a prank - pink foam everywhere. But Lex accidentally 
  activated it, and now..."
  
  [CUT TO: Visual of foam covering food, clothes, tech - all ruined]
  
  [CUT BACK TO: Maya]
  "In 60 minutes, the mall will be buried under foam. Food will be inedible, 
  clothes unbuyable, tech unusable. Lex is working on the technical side, but 
  the Phantom was a master puzzle-maker. He left clues scattered throughout 
  the mall. Each puzzle reveals a word - pieces of a message. Can you help 
  us solve them before it's too late?"
  ```

- **Hinting Strategy**:
  - Subtle hint: "Remember sudoku rules - each row, column, and 3x2 box needs numbers 1-6..."
