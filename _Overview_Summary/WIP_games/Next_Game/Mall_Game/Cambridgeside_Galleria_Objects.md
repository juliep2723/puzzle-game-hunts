**Body Paragraph (approximate but closely transcribed)**

> "An idea from science fiction is now one of the hottest areas of space science research. In 1996, scientists found possible evidence of ancient microorganisms in a Martian meteorite. The Martian rock, which fell to Earth after an asteroid impact blasted it away from the surface of Mars, contains organic chemicals and microscopic features that look like bacteria fossils. Will future spacecraft to Mars find more signs of life?"

**Notable Details**

* Paragraph is printed in white text on a dark starfield background, directly beneath a rectangular close-up image of Martian surface texture framed with a thin yellow border.
* The question mark is part of the title "Life on Mars?" and is the only punctuation in the heading.

**Visible Title**

**Body Paragraph (approximate but closely transcribed)**

> "The 'Red Planet' is red because it is covered with rusty dust–iron oxide. Huge dust storms blow the red dry soil around the planet, causing the sky to appear pink. In the summer of 1997, the spacecraft Pathfinder and robotic rover Sojourner gave us spectacular views of the Martian landscape."

**Notable Details**

* A rectangular color photograph of the Mars Pathfinder rover and rocky terrain sits directly below the paragraph, framed with a thin yellow border similar to the image above the "Life on Mars?" section.
