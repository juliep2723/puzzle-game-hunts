## Web-Based App Mini-Games (On-Phone Puzzles)

*All of these are played in a browser/app on the players’ phones, but are anchored to real mall locations.*

### **1. Smart Word Search (Auto-Reveal)**

- Classic letter grid on the phone; words are names of stores or eateries near the players.
- Players swipe to highlight words; the app automatically greys them out.
- When all target words are found, the remaining letters **auto-populate** into the solution phrase (no manual copying).
- The phrase is always something concrete: a unit number, store name, short instruction, or code.
- **Variants:**
  - Timed version (beat the clock for a tiny story bonus).
  - Cooperative version where each player’s screen reveals different words, and they must share.

### **2. In-App Cryptogram**

- App shows a monoalphabetic substitution (A→Q, B→T, etc.) with a short sentence related to the story.
- Players tap letters to cycle through possible replacements; the app auto-highlights correct words once solved.
- When fully decoded, the sentence says something like: “GO TO THE STORE WHERE THE BIRD WEARS JEANS” (American Eagle).
- **Variants:**
  - Emoji cryptogram (letters replaced with emojis that hint at stores).
  - Rotating cipher: after each beat, a new cipher key is introduced.

### **3. Compass / Arrow Navigator**

- The web app shows a big arrow that changes based on simple player input (“We’re at Apple now,” “We’re at the escalator,” etc.).
- Players tap a button like **“Point us toward the next clue”**, and the arrow/compass responds with:
  - “Face the closest escalator. Turn right.”
  - “Walk toward the side with more light.”
  - “Move toward the entrance with the most glass.”
- Each time they confirm “We’re here,” the app updates to give the next directional hint until they arrive at the target store.

### **4. Mini Maze on Screen, Real Maze Underfoot**

- On the phone, a simple top-down maze with a moving dot.
- Each junction in the digital maze corresponds to a choice in the mall (left/right, up/down escalator, Level 1/Level 2).
- The app lists choices as buttons:
  - LEFT = go toward Apple
  - RIGHT = go toward Sephora
  - UP = go to Level 2
  - DOWN = go to CanalSide
- If they choose incorrectly, the maze dead-ends and the app nudges them back; the correct path exits the maze and reveals the next code.

### **5. Tile/Slider Puzzles Using Real Photos**

- Phone shows a 3×3 or 4×4 sliding tile puzzle made from a photo of a mall location (directory, storefront, food court sign).
- When solved, the completed image becomes sharp and a small highlight circle appears around a specific detail (e.g., a unit number or arrow).
- That highlighted detail is the code or next location.

### **6. Pattern-Match Mini-Game (Logo Edition)**

- App shows a row of simplified logos (shapes/colors only), some real, some fake.
- Task: tap only the ones that match *real* stores in this mall.
- When they submit, the app:
  - Confirms which ones were right.
  - Uses the first letters or unit numbers of correct stores to build a code.

### **7. “Spot the Odd One Out” Grid**

- 4×4 grid of small photos or icons on the phone:
  - Example: shoes, shoes, shoes, ice cream cone.
  - Or food court logos, with one non-food logo.
- Players tap the odd one out in 3–4 grids in a row.
- Each correct odd-one-out reveals one letter/digit; together they spell the next clue.

### **8. Real-Time Voting / Poll Puzzles**

- App shows a quick poll question: “Which store feels the most ‘futuristic’ to you? A) Apple B) Tesla C) Zara.”
- Players vote; once they confirm, the app reveals:
  - “Whichever you picked is correct—go there now.”
- Mechanically, any option can be accepted; emotionally, players feel agency.

### **9. Micro Escape-Room Screens**

- For 1–2 minutes, the phone becomes a mini escape-room interface:
  - A picture of a locked digital drawer with 3 tappable objects (plant, clock, sign).
  - Tapping each zooms in and shows subtle clues (numbers, arrows, highlighted letters).
- When players deduce the 3-digit code and enter it, the drawer opens and shows:
  - A QR code to scan at a *real* location, or
  - A phrase pointing to a specific store.

### **10. AR “Sticker Hunt” (Low-Tech AR)**

- The app shows a semi-transparent overlay image (e.g., a gold sticker or symbol) plus a clue like: “Find where this belongs.”
- Players hold up their phone and visually line up the overlay with the real-world view (matching the shape to a sign or store front).
- Once they feel it matches, they tap **“We’re Here”** and type the visible unit number/text to confirm.

### **11. Audio Decoders**

- App plays a short sound file:
  - A pattern of beeps (Morse-lite).
  - A sequence of spoken syllables out of order.
  - Background mall noise with one clear repeated word.
- Players listen, then answer questions such as:
  - “What word did you hear three times?”
  - “Which store name fits this rhythm: DA-da-DA?” (e.g., Ma-NGO).
- Correct answer unlocks the next location, often a store whose name matches what they decoded.

### **12. Tap-to-Reveal “Fog of War” Map**

- App displays a simplified floor plan covered in semi-opaque “fog.”
- Players tap tiles to clear small patches of fog; they have a limited number of taps (e.g., 10).
- Underneath are icons for key locations (escalator, food court, specific stores).
- When they’ve uncovered enough to recognize the pattern, they must guess the target store or direction.

### **13. Sequence Memory (“Simon Says” with Stores)**

- App shows a short sequence of 3–5 store icons one after another.
- Players must physically visit those stores *in order*, sending a quick selfie or store-sign photo at each.
- After all photos arrive, the app replies with:
  - “Nice memory! The FIRST letter of the THIRD store in your sequence is your next clue.”

### **14. Error-Hunt Screens**

- App shows an illustrated mall scene with 5–7 intentional errors:
  - ZARA spelled “ZALA.”
  - An escalator from Level 1 directly to Level 3.
  - Food court labeled as “Parking Garage.”
- Players tap all the errors they can find; when they hit the required number, the app reveals a phrase built from the first letters of each mistaken element.

### **15. Timed “Reaction” Mini-Games**

- Very short tap games (20–30 seconds) that tie back to the mall:
  - Dots appear labeled with store initials; tap only Level 2 stores.
  - Food icons fall; tap only CanalSide eateries.
- After the round, the app summarizes:
  - “You correctly tapped 7 Level 2 stores. Code digit = 7.”

### **16. Collaborative Code Entry**

- Each player’s phone receives a different part of a code (e.g., “_ 3 _ 7” vs. “2 _ 5 _”).
- They must talk together to reconstruct the full code and enter it on one device.
- The app only accepts the complete solution, reinforcing cooperative play.

### **17. “Choose Your Explanation” Branching Text**

- The app presents a weird fact about the mall (“The food court used to be a parking lot”) and three possible explanations.
- Whichever explanation players choose becomes “true” for their story branch and slightly colors later text.
- Mechanically, all explanations lead to the same puzzle; emotionally, players feel like co-authors of the lore.

## Combination Mechanics

### **Multi-Step Puzzles**

**Puzzle Chain:**
- Puzzle 1 → Reveals location for Puzzle 2
- Puzzle 2 → Reveals code for Puzzle 3
- Puzzle 3 → Reveals final solution
- Example: "Word search → Reveals unit number → Go to unit → Find code"

**Puzzle Combination:**
- Combine solutions from multiple puzzles
- Pattern: "Puzzle 1 gives letter, Puzzle 2 gives number, combine = code"
- Example: "Letter F + Number 3 = Code F3 or location clue"

**Puzzle Sequence:**
- Puzzles must be solved in specific order
- Order revealed by: story, previous puzzle, video
- Example: "Solve word search first, then directory clues, then spot difference"

---

## Winter Considerations

**All Indoor:**
- No outdoor elements (no parks, no outdoor signs)
- All puzzles use indoor mall fixtures
- Focus on: stores, directory boards, food court, escalators, elevators

**Weather-Proof:**
- No weather-dependent puzzles
- All locations accessible regardless of weather
- Controlled environment = reliable puzzle execution

**Lighting:**
- Mall lighting consistent
- No daylight-dependent puzzles
- All puzzles work regardless of time of day

---

## 2. The "Josh Wardle" Collection (Logic & Deduction)

*Focus: Elimination, patterns, and feedback loops.*

### **"Mall-dle" (Real-Life Wordle)**
**Concept:** The Guide Character has chosen a "Secret Store." Players have 5 guesses to find it.
*   **Mechanic:** Players text a store name. The Guide responds with "Wordle-style" feedback based on the store's physical location or attributes.
*   **Guess 1:** "Apple" -> Guide: "Wrong floor (Gray), Right wing (Green), Wrong category (Gray)."
*   **Guess 2:** "Sephora" -> Guide: "Right floor (Green), Right wing (Green), Wrong category (Gray)."
*   **Guess 3:** "Zara" -> Guide: "Correct!"

### **The "Logic Grid" of Tenants**
**Concept:** A classic logic puzzle overlaid on the physical mall directory.
*   **Clues:**
    1.  "The Secret Store is not next to a shoe store."
    2.  "The Secret Store is directly below a store that sells food."
    3.  "The Secret Store has exactly 4 letters."
*   **Task:** Players must physically walk the mall to verify neighbors (since directories might not show perfect adjacency) and eliminate options until only one remains.

### **The "Binary Floor" Code**
**Concept:** Using the up/down nature of the mall as a binary language.
*   **Clue:** A sequence of stores is listed: *Apple, TJ Maxx, Sephora, Foot Locker, Aldo.*
*   **Translation:**
    *   Apple (Level 1) = 0
    *   TJ Maxx (Level 2) = 1
    *   Sephora (Level 1) = 0
    *   Foot Locker (Level 2) = 1
    *   Aldo (Level 1) = 0
*   **Result:** 01010 (Binary for 10). The code is 10.

---

## 3. The "Amazing Race" Collection (Kinetic & Navigational)

*Focus: Movement, physical tasks, and perspective.*

### **The "Human Protractor"**
**Concept:** Measuring distance without standard tools.
*   **Task:** "How many 'pigeon steps' (heel-to-toe) does it take to walk from the entrance of the Apple Store to the entrance of Sephora?"
*   **Tolerance:** The lockbox accepts a range (e.g., 45-50 steps).
*   **Why it works:** It forces players to move slowly and deliberately, looking silly (fun!) while focusing intensely on the space.

### **The "Window Shopping" Budget**
**Concept:** A math challenge based on changing window displays.
*   **Task:** "You have exactly $150.00 virtual dollars. Find three items in the window of *T.J. Maxx* that add up to exactly $150.00 (or closest to it without going over)."
*   **Mechanic:** Players text the three prices.
*   **Note:** Requires a quick scout by the Game Master beforehand to ensure prices are visible, or use a store with fixed prices like a menu at the Food Court.

### **The "Perspective Shift" (Anamorphosis)**
**Concept:** Finding the specific spot where chaos aligns into order.
*   **Task:** "Stand exactly on the 'You Are Here' star on the Level 1 directory. Look up at the balcony of Level 2. Count the number of vertical railing bars between the 'Z' in Zara and the 'T' in TJ Maxx."
*   **Why it works:** It turns the architecture into the puzzle board.

### **The "Silent Disco" Navigation**
**Concept:** Following audio cues rather than visual ones.
*   **Mechanic:** Players wear headphones (or share a phone speaker). The Guide sends an audio file. It’s a recording of a walk through the mall.
*   **Audio:** *Footsteps... faint sound of water (CanalSide)... louder chatter... the sound of a blender (Smoothie shop)... silence... a specific song playing from a store.*
*   **Task:** "Retrace the path of the audio recording. What store is the person standing in front of when the recording ends?"

---

## 4. The "Dave Barry" Collection (Humor & Absurdity)

*Focus: Social daring, silly observations, and "I am not making this up."*

### **The "Mannequin Challenge"**
**Concept:** Mimicking the environment.
*   **Task:** "Find the most ridiculously posed mannequin in the mall. Recreate the pose exactly with your team. Take a photo."
*   **The Twist:** The clue isn't the pose. The clue is *what the mannequin is looking at*. "Follow the mannequin's gaze. What is the first word on the sign it is staring at?"

### **The "Bad Review" Hunt**
**Concept:** Using fictional (or curated) reviews to find a location.
*   **Clue:** "I gave this place 1 star because the water was too wet and the boats were too boat-y."
*   **Location:** Charles River Boat Company.
*   **Clue:** "5 Stars. I ate a cloud here."
*   **Location:** Beard Papa's (Cream puffs) or Far Out Ice Cream.

### **The "Wrong Way" Directory**
**Concept:** Giving directions that are technically correct but absurdly inefficient.
*   **Task:** "Go to the Main Entrance. Turn left. Walk until you see a picture of a burger. Turn 180 degrees. Walk backwards for 20 paces. Look left. What is the unit number of the store you are facing?"

---

## 5. The "National Treasure" Collection (Hidden History & Symbols)

*Focus: Treating the mall like a historical artifact.*

### **The "Ghost Store" Rubbing**
**Concept:** Finding physical textures.
*   **Task:** "Find the plaque for the 'CambridgeSide Tailoring' (G1). Place a piece of paper over the raised letters and do a pencil rubbing of the first letter." (If signs are raised).
*   **Alternative:** "Find the date established on the CambridgeSide plaque (if exists). If no date, find the maximum capacity number on the elevator plate."

### **The "Floor Is Lava" Maze**
**Concept:** Using the floor tile patterns.
*   **Task:** "At the CanalSide entrance, there is a pattern of light and dark tiles. You must walk from the door to the C-Side Bar stepping ONLY on light tiles. If you step on a dark tile, you must restart."
*   **The Clue:** The path forces them to walk in a shape (e.g., a letter 'S' or a number '8'). "What shape did you just walk?"

### **The "Reflection" Code**
**Concept:** Using mirrors and glass.
*   **Task:** "Go to the Sephora window. Look at the reflection of the store *across* the hall in the glass. Read the store name backwards in the reflection. The 3rd letter is your key."

---

## 6. The "Escape Room" Collection (Tactile & Interactive)

*Focus: Using physical objects in the environment.*

### **The "Receipt" Cipher**
**Concept:** Players find a "lost receipt" (provided in their starting lockbox/bag).
*   **Prop:** A fake receipt listing items like:
    *   1x Apple
    *   2x Panda (Pandora)
    *   1x Eagle (American Eagle)
*   **Task:** "Go to these stores. The receipt lists the quantity. Find the Unit Number of each store. Multiply the Unit Number by the Quantity. Sum them up for the code."

### **The "Color Swatch" Match**
**Concept:** Matching paint chips.
*   **Prop:** Players are given a physical paint chip (e.g., a specific shade of teal).
*   **Task:** "Find the store front that matches this exact color." (e.g., Tiffany's or a specific part of the Lululemon facade).
*   **Reward:** Once they send a photo confirming the match, they get the next clue.

---

## 7. The "Spycraft" Collection (Stealth & Observation)

*Focus: Blending in and covert operations.*

### **The "Dead Drop" Simulation**
**Concept:** Retrieving info without being "noticed."
*   **Task:** "A 'contact' (a specific poster or standee) is holding intel at the AMC Theater entrance (or similar). Walk past it casually. Do not stop. Record the 3-digit number in the bottom right corner of the poster."

### **The "Conversation" Eavesdrop**
**Concept:** Listening to a pre-recorded conversation (via link) that sounds like ambient mall noise.
*   **Audio:** Background noise, footsteps, then a voice says: *"I left the package under the sign that says 'Clearance'."*
*   **Task:** Find the store with a "Clearance" sign in the window right now. (Requires a quick scout to ensure one exists, or use a permanent sign like "Restrooms").

## 8. The "Julie Collection" (Seeing the Unseen, Grounded Magic)

*Focus: Emotional resonance, hidden narratives, and the extraordinary in the ordinary.*

### **The "Mall Walker" Witness**
**Concept:** Using the invisible people who know the mall best.
*   **Setup:** At the start, players receive a description: "An older person in comfortable shoes, walking briskly for exercise. They've walked this mall every morning for 5 years."
*   **Task:** Players must politely approach mall walkers (real people exercising) and ask: "Excuse me, have you seen any stores change in the past year?" Most won't know about the game, but their real answers become the clues.
*   **The Magic:** One mall walker IS part of the game (planted by you) and says a specific phrase: "The only constant is the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree." This reveals that Apple store (unit 1-30) is the stable anchor point.
*   **Why it works:** It makes players see the "invisible" community members and creates real human connection. The game doesn't exist only in your phone—it exists in conversations.

### **The "First Time" Perspective**
**Concept:** Seeing the mall as if it's your first time here.
*   **Task:** "Stand at the Main Entrance. Close your eyes. Now open them. You are a visitor from another country who has never seen these stores. What is the FIRST thing your eyes notice? The brightest color? The biggest word? The shiniest surface?"
*   **The Clue:** Whatever they notice first, that's their clue. "Text me the first word you saw." Different people will see different things, but the Guide accepts multiple answers because the *noticing* is what matters.
*   **Why it works:** It forces a fresh perspective on a familiar space. The puzzle isn't "find the right answer"—it's "see something new."

### **The "Three Generations" Interview**
**Concept:** Finding the emotional history of the mall.
*   **Task:** "Find three people of different generations shopping together (parent, child, grandchild). Ask them: 'What's your favorite store here and why?'"
*   **The Clue:** The store names they mention. "Text me the three stores. The first letters spell your next location."
*   **The Twist:** If they can't find three generations, they can ask three separate people of different ages. The magic is in hearing real stories.
*   **Why it works:** It celebrates the mall as a community space across time, not just a puzzle board.

### **The "Store Window Stories"**
**Concept:** Every window display tells a story if you look closely enough.
*   **Task:** "Go to the ZARA window display. Look at it for 60 seconds—no phones, just look. Now answer: If these mannequins could talk, what would they say to each other? Text me your answer."
*   **The Guide Response:** "I love your imagination! The mannequin on the left is facing store unit [X]. That's your next clue."
*   **Why it works:** It rewards imagination and observation, not just logic. Every answer gets validated, but the clue is in the physical layout.

### **The "Employee Secret"**
**Concept:** People who work here know things customers don't.
*   **Task:** "Go to any store on Level 1. Politely ask an employee: 'What's something customers don't know about this mall?' Listen to their answer."
*   **The Real Clue:** While they're answering, observe: "What unit number is visible from where you're standing?" That number becomes part of your code.
*   **Why it works:** It creates real conversation and makes employees feel seen, while the actual puzzle is happening in parallel.

### **The "Sound Map"**
**Concept:** The mall has a soundscape you've never noticed.
*   **Task:** "Stand in the middle of CanalSide Food Court. Close your eyes for 30 seconds. What do you hear? List three distinct sounds (not conversations—just sounds)."
*   **Expected Answers:** Blender, footsteps, plates clinking, music, water (from waterfront), cash register
*   **The Clue:** "Count how many food court eateries have the same first letter as one of your sounds. That's your code digit."
*   **Why it works:** It makes players *hear* the space, not just see it. The mall becomes alive.

### **The "Favorite Thing" Collection**
**Concept:** Building empathy through preferences.
*   **Setup:** Throughout the game, the Guide character drops personal details: "My favorite color is blue" or "I love places that smell like fresh bread" or "I always notice clocks."
*   **Task:** "Find a store that would make me happy based on what you know about me."
*   **The Clue:** Any store that matches their criteria works (e.g., blue logo, bakery, watch store). "Send me a photo of why you chose this store."
*   **Why it works:** It's about knowing someone, not just solving a puzzle. Players become invested in the Guide's happiness.

### **The "Before and After"**
**Concept:** The mall changes throughout the day without you noticing.
*   **Setup:** Early in the game, players are told: "Take a photo of the directory board at the Main Entrance. You'll need it later."
*   **Task (Later):** "Go back to that directory board. Compare your photo to what you see now. What changed?"
*   **Possible Changes:** "You Are Here" sticker moved, a store sign updated, lighting different, people in different positions
*   **The Clue:** "The number of things that changed is your code digit."
*   **Why it works:** It reveals that the mall is alive and changing, not static. You were here, but were you paying attention?

### **The "Gratitude Scavenger Hunt"**
**Concept:** Finding beauty in mundane infrastructure.
*   **Task:** "Find something in this mall that you never noticed before but someone worked hard to create—a design detail, a helpful sign, a comfortable seating area, a plant that someone waters. Send me a photo and tell me why it matters."
*   **The Clue:** Every answer is accepted. The Guide responds: "Beautiful! The [specific detail you noticed] is near store unit [X]. That's your next location."
*   **Why it works:** It shifts the lens from "the mall is just a place to shop" to "the mall is designed with care." Players leave feeling different about the space.

### **The "Invisible Paths"**
**Concept:** People move through the mall in patterns you don't see.
*   **Task:** "Stand at the base of the escalator. Watch people for 2 minutes. Count how many people turn LEFT after coming down the escalator vs. turn RIGHT."
*   **The Clue:** "The direction MORE people choose is your direction. Go that way until you reach a store with [specified letter] in the name."
*   **Why it works:** It makes players see crowd behavior as information. The mall isn't just a space—it's a flow of humanity.

### **The "Joy Audit"**
**Concept:** Finding evidence of happiness.
*   **Task:** "Find three signs that someone felt joy here today. Examples: a dropped balloon, a shopping bag with tissue paper peeking out, a couple laughing, a kid running, someone taking a selfie."
*   **The Clue:** "Text me what you found. The number of people you saw smiling is your code digit."
*   **Why it works:** It reframes the mall as a place of happiness, not just commerce. Players become hunters of joy.

### **The "What Would [Character] Do?"**
**Concept:** Seeing through someone else's needs.
*   **Setup:** The Guide describes someone: "My little cousin is 6 years old, loves animals, and gets scared in crowds."
*   **Task:** "Walk through the mall and find the spot where my cousin would feel safest and happiest. Send me a photo and explain why."
*   **Accepted Answers:** Quiet corner, animal poster, cozy seating area, brightly lit friendly store, etc.
*   **The Clue:** The Guide responds: "Perfect! From there, face the [direction]. The first store you see is your next destination."
*   **Why it works:** It builds empathy and makes players think about the mall as experienced by different people.

### **The "Time Capsule" Discovery**
**Concept:** What would you want to remember about this moment?
*   **Task:** "If you were leaving a time capsule here for someone to find in 10 years, what would you photograph to show them what this mall was like today?"
*   **The Clue:** After they send their photo, the Guide says: "In 10 years, that store might be something else. Look for a store that opened RECENTLY (has a 'Grand Opening' or 'Now Open' sign, or looks very new). That store is replacing the old one. The number in its unit number is your clue."
*   **Why it works:** It makes players think about change, time, and preservation—themes of memory and growth.

### **The "Hidden Kindness" Mission**
**Concept:** Creating a positive moment for others (paying it forward).
*   **Task:** "Do something kind for a stranger in the mall. Hold a door, give a genuine compliment, help someone reach something, let someone go ahead of you in line. Do NOT tell them it's part of a game."
*   **The Reward:** "Text me what you did. This doesn't give you a code—it gives you something better. (The Guide sends a video message praising them.)"
*   **The Secret Clue:** "While you were being kind, you were standing near a store. What was its unit number?" That's the real code.
*   **Why it works:** It makes the game about creating real goodness in the world, not just solving puzzles. The puzzle happens around the kindness, not instead of it.

### **The "Mall as Memory Palace"**
**Concept:** Attaching personal meaning to neutral spaces.
*   **Task:** "Think of a happy memory. Now find a spot in this mall that reminds you of that memory in some small way. It could be a color, a smell, a sound, a feeling."
*   **The Clue:** "Text me the spot you chose and why." The Guide responds: "Beautiful memory. From that spot, walk 20 steps toward the place where people gather to eat (CanalSide). Look left. What store do you see?"
*   **Why it works:** It personalizes the mall. This isn't just any mall—it's now connected to their memories and emotions.

## The "Julie Philosophy" Behind These Mechanics

**What Makes These Different:**

1. **People Are Puzzles Too:** The best clues come from real interactions with real people who didn't know they were part of the game.

2. **Emotion Unlocks Logic:** Before you can find the code, you must feel something—notice something beautiful, remember something meaningful, help someone, imagine someone else's experience.

3. **Multiple Right Answers:** Not every puzzle has one solution. Sometimes the journey of observation is the point, and the "code" reveals itself in the process.

4. **The Mall Is Alive:** It's not a static backdrop—it's a living system of people, sounds, changes, emotions, and stories.

5. **You Leave Different Than You Arrived:** The best puzzles don't just give you a code—they change how you see the world. After playing, the mall isn't just a mall anymore. It's a place where you noticed beauty, helped someone, saw invisible people, heard hidden sounds, and connected memories to spaces.

6. **Grounded in Reality:** No fake props needed (though they can help). The magic is already there in the real employees, real mall walkers, real directory boards, real window displays. Your job is just to point a flashlight at what was always there.

7. **Fun Through Discovery, Not Difficulty:** These puzzles aren't hard—they're delightful. The challenge isn't "can you solve this?" It's "can you see this? can you imagine this? can you feel this?"

---

*These mechanics honor the Julie tradition: reality as the game board, community as the gameplay, and the transformation of the ordinary into the extraordinary. The mall was always magical—we're just giving players the glasses to see it.*

*Focus: Bringing in new kinds of expertise to deepen joy, pride, focus, hope, and intrigue.*

### What Skills Felt Under-Represented?

- **Flow & Focus:** Keeping kids in the "just right" challenge zone (not bored, not overwhelmed).
- **Accessible Play:** Making sure shy kids, kids with different bodies, and kids with different brains can all shine.
- **Celebration & Feedback:** Building in honest, fun moments where players feel proud of what they just did.
- **Cooperative Decision-Making:** Letting teams make meaningful choices together, not just follow orders.
- **Improv & Playfulness:** Letting players create part of the game themselves in the moment.
