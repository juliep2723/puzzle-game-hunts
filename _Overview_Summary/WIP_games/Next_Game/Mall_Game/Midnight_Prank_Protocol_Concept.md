# The Midnight Prank Protocol - Game Concept & Design Ideas

*Working document for hook coherence and final puzzle brainstorming*

## A. Game Concept

### The Problem

Lex has been researching the mall's history for a new music video when he discovered something incredible: In the 1980s, a legendary prankster named "The Foam Phantom" worked as a mall engineer and secretly rigged the entire building with an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine. The plan was to create the ultimate prank—10,000 gallons of pink foam erupting from fountains, planters, and hidden vents to turn the mall into a foam party.

The prank was never triggered... until now. While examining the old blueprints, Lex accidentally activated the 40-year-old system. The machine is warming up, and in 60 minutes, the mall will be buried under mountains of pink foam. Lex is trying to trace the original trigger point, but he needs help finding the kill switches scattered throughout the mall.

### Your Mission

Maya is frantically texting for help. Lex accidentally triggered the prank while researching the mall's history, and now you need to understand what the Foam Phantom built—and how to stop it—before the foam destroys everything.

The Phantom was a master puzzle-maker. He didn't just rig the mall with foam machines—he left clues scattered throughout, hidden in plain sight. Each clue reveals a piece of the puzzle. Each piece brings you closer to understanding how the prank works and how to stop it.

**Your journey is backwards:** The foam will flow from its starting point through the mall. But to stop it, you must trace that path in reverse—from where it ends back to where it starts, so that you can stop it before it starts. Follow the clues, understand the Phantom's design, and find the source before it's too late.

**You're collecting words**—pieces of a message the Phantom left behind. Share everything you discover with Maya over text. She's piecing together the clues with you, trying to understand what the Phantom intended. These words hold the key to stopping the prank, but only when you understand what they mean together.

**The Phantom's puzzles are everywhere:** In the paths Lex walked, in the connections between stores, in hidden corners of the mall, in the games people play, in the infrastructure that powers everything. Each puzzle reveals another word. Each word is part of a larger message. And that message will tell you exactly how to stop what the Phantom started 40 years ago.

**Key Understanding:** The Rube Goldberg machine flows through the mall in a specific path. To stop it, you must trace that path backwards—from where it ends back to where it begins. Only by following the prank backwards can you find where it starts and stop it at the source.

## B. Game Mechanics & Super Puzzle

### The Five Mechanics (Beats 2-6)

#### Beat 1: Introduction to the game
Players message Maya and she provides backstory via video & short Telegram text with first question to move players into Beat 2.

- **Created With:** AI image & video generators, shared over Telegram Text: Julie to do

Each beat 2-6 reveals one word that forms part of the Phantom's abort phrase: **"FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE"**

#### Beat 2: Following Lex's Path (Word: "FOAM")
**Mechanic:** Spot the Difference
- **Setup:** Video shows Lex filming his music video, walking through the mall
- **Mall Action:** Players retrace Lex's footsteps to the same locations shown in video
- **Mobile Game:** Maya sends spot-the-difference images one at a time - players compare reality to photo and report differences. Maybe in each picture there is a missing or added letter, so 4 images, spelling FOAM one lettr at a time.
- **Differences Reveal:** "FOAM"
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows part of Rube Goldberg chain superimposed on mall location, foam visible in video
- **Word Collection:** Players share "FOAM" with Maya over Telegram Text
- **Created With:** AI image & video generators, shared over Telegram Text: Julie to do

#### Beat 3: Hidden Connections (Word: "PHANTOM")
**Mechanic:** Word Search Puzzle
- **Setup:** Maya explains they need to find stores with common themes
- **Mall Action:** Players identify stores matching criteria (fruits, royal motifs, items from Cambridgeside mural) through Telegram exchange with Maya
- **Mobile Game:** Maya shares link to word search puzzle - players find store names in grid, remaining letters spell message
- **Message Reveals:** The word **"PHANTOM"**
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows another section of Rube Goldberg chain, foam flowing through different part of mall
- **Word Collection:** Players share "PHANTOM" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Julie create clues by hand and puzzle design by hand, Kai create word search & remaining letter discloser in browser-game. The finding the words mechanic would be done with Maya over Telegram Text exchange (e.g. they're given store names to find, and she validates and gives clues until all stores were correctly named. That way in the app, the list could be included on the screen, because Maya gives the link to the game only after all store names were discovered by players). Kai to create word search mechanism & code reveal for in browser.

#### Beat 4: Decoding the Phantom's Clues (Word: "PRANK")
**Mechanic:** Planet Table Cipher
- **Setup:** Maya directs players to find Museum of Science planet table (obscure location on 2nd floor)
- **Mall Action:** Players find planet table, read planet distances and locations
- **Mobile Game:** Players share each planet distance correctly - Maya acts as cipher, giving letter associated with each discovery until word is spelled
- **Cipher Reveals:** The word **"PRANK"**
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows Rube Goldberg mechanism activating, foam building pressure
- **Word Collection:** Players share "PRANK" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Julie to create puzzle, as in what are the 5 questions and answers for Maya to have the conversation over Telegram Text

#### Beat 5: Playing Your Way to the Solution (Word: "ABORT")
**Mechanic:** Food Court Game + Unlock
- **Setup:** Maya directs players to food court
- **Mall Action:** Players choose and play a real game (cornhole, Connect 4, or Jenga), report winner, share photo
- **Maya's Response:** Funny/quirky response about the game result
- **Unlock:** This unlocks access to next puzzle (Maze puzzle)
- **Word Reveals:** The word **"ABORT"** 
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows foam reaching critical point, Rube Goldberg chain nearly complete
- **Word Collection:** Players share "ABORT" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Either Julie creates png of the puzzle for Maya to share in text for them to read their way out of the maze, or Kai creates in-browser game version where they trace with hands. Either would work, but has to be big enough on screen - I haven't played a maze game with hand in an app, so should discuss.

#### Beat 6: Tracing the Power Source (Word: "CODE")
**Mechanic:** Pipes Location -> Sudoku
- **Setup:** Maya explains they need to find where the prank starts
- **Acrostic Puzzle:** Directed to a set of pipes where they're told which letters to read (e.g. 3rd word, 4th letter), until they've read the final word
- **Mall Action:** Players navigate to pipes location to location following Maya's Telegram Text message instructions
- **Discovery:** This is the starting point of the Rube Goldberg machine - foam flows from here through mall to food court
- **Video Reveal:** Video goes through vents showing foam and pathway - players see the complete Rube Goldberg path
- **Word Reveals:** The word **"CODE"** (final word of the phrase)
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows complete Rube Goldberg chain, foam ready to explode
- **Word Collection:** Players share "CODE" with Maya over text and get the final sudoku in browser-game format
- **Sudoku:** They solve sudoku to get the 3-digit code to give to Maya
- **Created With:** Julie creates clues to read "CODE" and Kai creates in-browser game sudoku.

### The Super Puzzle (After Beat 6, Before Beat 7)

**All 5 Words Collected:** "FOAM" "PHANTOM" "PRANK" "ABORT" "CODE"

**The Abort Phrase:** Players now have all pieces of the Phantom's safety phrase: **"FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE"**

- **Action:** Players share the complete phrase "FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE" plus the 3-digit Sudoku code with Maya
- **Maya's Response:** Confirms phrase is correct, explains this is the Phantom's safety code
- **Resolution:** Maya uses the phrase + code to remotely deactivate the prank system (or directs players to location where they can enter it)
- **Success:** Prank is stopped, foam machine powers down, mall is saved

#### Why This Works:
- **Coherent Hook:** All 5 words form a meaningful phrase - the Phantom's abort code
- **Progressive Discovery:** Words seem unrelated until final puzzle reveals they're a phrase
- **Sudoku Integration:** Sudoku provides the numeric component needed to activate the phrase
- **Satisfying Payoff:** Speaking/typing the phrase feels like using a magic password
- **Story Integration:** The Phantom built in a safety mechanism - players discover and use it
- **Emotional Arc:** From collecting random words to understanding they form a safety code to successfully using it
