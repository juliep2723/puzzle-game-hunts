## Mechanics for puzzle solving

### Text & Word-Based Puzzles

*   **Acrostic Messages:** The first letter of each line of a specific "Dana Park Quote" sign (e.g., the Longfellow sign) spells out a secret word or instruction.
*   **Targeted Word Retrieval:** Players are directed to a specific Square sign (e.g., "Square G") and told to find the 3rd word on the 2nd line.
*   **Pick out the letters following rules:** Players go from sign to sign (or all within 1 sign) and must follow a set of numbers like: 5-3-2, 4-2-1, when the first number is the line, the second number is the word, and the third number is the letter. So, in the case of 5-3-2, it means that at that sign they look at the 5th line, the 3rd word, and the 2nd letter of that word to write down that letter, before moving to the next sign in their list. An alternative is instead of the first number being the number of the line, it could also be the number of a lamp post, so 5-3-1 means plaque on lamp post 5, 3rd word, and first letter of that word.
*   **Word Search with Hidden Message:** A classic word search (delivered as a physical clue) tells them to cross out the last names on the quote signs at Dana Park (or contains names of the authors from the Dana Park quote signs). The letters not used in the search, when read left-to-right, spell out an answer or their next clue.
*   **Anagram Challenge:** Players must rearrange the letters resulting from a different puzzle in the game, or from something they see in person (e.g., name on a park bench or plaque, or as a second-step of the Blackout Poetry clue or a hidden message in a video, etc.), or from a name on one of the Square signs (e.g., "ARTHUR SERTINO") to form a relevant word or phrase.
*   **Quote as Instruction:** A puzzle's solution requires following the literal instruction of a quote. For example, the M. L. King quote "IT'S NECESSARY TO GO BACKWARD IN ORDER TO GO FORWARD" could be a hint to read a sequence of numbers or a word backwards.
*   **Blackout Poetry:** Players are given a digital image of a sign or plaque and must "black out" words based on a set of rules (e.g., "remove letters or words that meet this criteria: ___ list of criteria" or "remove all words with fewer than 4 letters") to reveal a hidden message in the remaining letters / words.
*   **Cipher Substitution:** A simple substitution cipher (A=C, B=D, etc.) is provided, and players must apply it to a specific word on a sign, like the "MILK" sticker on the emergency call box or a name on a Square, or applied to a different puzzle in the game. Cipher substitutions in a game are best if used more than once, e.g., as in a surprising way to discover the true identity of a villain or something challenging to get you out of the Dark Night of the Soul step of the game. Note: Only one cipher per game is recommended to avoid confusion.
*   **Regulations as a Key:** The list of prohibited actions on the "Park Regulations" sign is used as a negative key. For example, a list of words is provided, and players must cross off any related to "alcohol," "fires," or "loud music" to reveal the remaining words.

### Number & Math Puzzles

*   **Date Arithmetic:** Players must use the birth and death dates on a Square sign. For example, "Go to Square F. Subtract the birth year from the death year. The second digit of the result is the first number in the code."
*   **Lamppost Sequence:** The numbered lampposts in Dana Park (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9) present a broken sequence. The puzzle could be to identify the missing numbers (6, 7, 8) or to use the existing numbers as a code.
*   **Sudoku for a Code:** A physical Sudoku puzzle is hidden on-site OR within a locked bag or box (easier to orchestrate inside the bag or box way). Once solved, the numbers in specific pre-shaded squares (e.g., the corners) form the 3-digit combination to a lockbox. Or the code tells you which signs to look at (e.g., lamp post signs, in order, to find letters that relate to a cipher, or something interesting like that...).
*   **Phone Number Digits:** Players are told to look at the phone number for the DPW on the Park Regulations sign (349-4800). A rule is given, such as "Use the first, fourth, and sixth digits as the code."
*   **Counting Challenge:** Simple observation tasks that yield a number. Examples: "How many frogs are on one of the metal medallions?" (3), "How many stars can you see on all the Square signs combined?", "How many benches are under the pergola?"
*   **Statistic as a Key:** The food allergy sign states "1 in 13 children has a food allergy." The numbers 1 and 13 could be a key to a puzzle (e.g., "read the 1st and 13th word of the Margaret Fuller quote").

### Physical Lock Puzzles

*   **Lockbag contains a key for a lockbox:** A 3-digit lockbag, once unlocked, contains a key that can be used to unlock a lockbox. This requires players to get one or more lockbags and lockboxes at the beginning of the game that they cannot access until they unlock the respective bag that contains the key to the lockbox. Note: Players should start with all the lockboxes they need for the full game so that they don't have to be hidden in the real world. Lockboxes can come in various colors (e.g., pink, red, blue, black, white, and a bigger green box) with keys that match the color of their box.
*   **Lockboxes contain a clue:** Locked boxes contain the next clue or hint or URL or cipher or secret message from another character in audio or video form (accessed through a link) and mini prizes to keep players excited. Could be flat colored marbles that have some significance for later or candy or knickknack. Note that the keys for the lockboxes should be held within lockbags, since unlocking one box after another isn't fun unless you just discovered the key and the best way to operationally execute this is through the bag once they discover the 3-digit code.

### Environmental & Observational Puzzles

*   **Color-Coded Clue:** A clue references a sequence of colors found in the park. For example: "Red Button, Green Light, Blue Bowl" (from the emergency call box) could correspond to a sequence needed to solve another puzzle.
*   **"I Spy" Riddle:** A riddle whose answer is a unique object in the park. For example: "I have a checkerboard but am not used for kings, I offer a seat but have no swings. What am I?" (Answer: The game table).
*   **Symbol Mapping:** Players are given a sheet with symbols on it (a dog icon, a tree icon, a water fountain icon). They must find those objects in the park and write down a specific detail about each (e.g., the number on the lamppost the dog sign is on).
*   **Photo Framing Task:** Players are instructed to take a photo from a specific perspective. For example: "Stand at the 'HELP' button and take a photo that captures both the little kids' slide and the basketball hoop. The object in the middle of your photo is the next clue's location."
*   **Follow the Path:** A printed maze is found taped under a slide OR the maze was within a locked bag (easier to orchestrate that way). The path through the maze passes over a series of letters that starts in regular English, but then goes into a cipher that must be decrypted and then spells out the URL (through a bit.ly) that has either a video or their next clue, or spells out the password for a website.
*   **Location Triangulation:** Using the map of Squares, players are told: "Draw a straight line from Square A to Square L, and another from Square F to Square K. The Square closest to where the lines intersect holds the next clue."
*   **Contradiction Hunt:** Players are given a "fact" via text that is incorrect, maybe through a song or through a video message (simulating a call or a memory). One of the signs (either on their walk between parks or at Dana Park) proves the fauty "fact" and that sign either has an important date or letter or word that is used somehwere else in the game.

### Logic & Multi-Step Puzzles

*   **Two-Source Logic Puzzle:** Information from two different places must be combined. For example: "Go to the Longfellow sign on lamppost #9. Then go to the Binstock sign on lamppost #1. Subtract the smaller number from the larger one. This is the first digit of the code."
*   **Grid Logic Puzzle:** A classic logic grid puzzle is provided as a handout. The clues to solve it must be found by observing things in the park (e.g., "The person who likes the color red sits next to the person who saw the seesaw."). The solution to the grid reveals the final answer.
*   **If/Then Sequence:** Players receive a series of conditional instructions. "Go to the water fountain. If it has a sticker on it, go to the pergola. If it does not, go to the basketball court. At the pergola, find the sign about food allergies and count the steps listed."
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Players are sent to the patterned ground border near the frog medallions and must decode the repeating pattern of dragonflies and leaves (e.g., Dragonfly-Leaf-Leaf-Dragonfly) to get a sequence.
*   **Exclusion Puzzle:** Players are shown photos of all 8 Dana Park quote signs and must identify the one that is different based on a specific rule (e.g., "Find the only sign whose author's last name is also a common noun or verb" - Fuller, Orne).
*   **Chessboard Cipher:** The game table has a built-in chessboard. A clue gives a series of coordinates (e.g., A4, C8, G3), which correspond to specific letters when using a standard chess grid.
*   **Chronological Reordering:** Players must find all the poet plaques, note the birth years, and arrange the poets in chronological order. The first letter of each poet's last name in that sequence spells out a word.
*   **Contradiction Hunt:** Players are given a "fact" via text (e.g., "The brother said he saw a sign about a soldier from the Korean War."). They must search the Square signs to find the one that contradicts this "fact" (e.g., they are all WWII or from other eras). That sign's location is the key.
*   **Hidden QR Code Riddle:** A riddle's answer points to a physical location where a QR code is hidden. For example: "I have a face but no eyes, and a single red button for my cries. Look behind me." The answer is the Emergency Call Box, and a QR code is taped to the back of it.

### Puzzles Using the "Square" Memorial Signs (A-L)

*   **Military Service Filter:** The sister texts: "My brother mentioned a soldier who wasn't in WWII." The players must find the one Square sign that mentions a different conflict (or none), and the name on that sign is the password.
*   **First Name Acrostic:** A clue instructs players to take the first letter of the first name on signs A, C, E, G, and K to spell a word.
*   **Initial Cipher:** A clue provides a cipher based on middle initials found on the signs. For example, "H. Nadelli gives us H=N, and W. Vera gives us W=V." Players use these pairings to decode a message. Note: Only one cipher per game is recommended to avoid confusion.
*   **The Star & No Star:** The sister asks for the last names on all the signs that have a star on them. The first letters of these names form an anagram for the next location.
*   **Geographic Logic:** Using the map, a clue asks: "Find the easternmost Square. The number of letters in that soldier's last name is the first digit of the code."
*   **Puzzles from the Squares signs:** Picking letters from a few signs. Note, the signs will not be shared in the way you see them, meaning on the map with the letters A-J. Instead, players will be told to find the "Square" at a specific location (either by the addresses or by being given the Google Maps links for them) and then any number of the discovering the letters on it will be used. The hope is they solve 1 word by collecting letters between Morse Park and Dana Square Park. Could be an anagram or cipher for the word. (Note: only 1 cipher per game, meaning the game shouldn't have multiple ciphers, since it's too confusing. So, only 1 cipher for the game in total.)

### Puzzles Bridging Video & Reality

*   **The Digital Ghost:** A short, found-footage video shows the musician's hand reaching under the park's game table to tape a clue there. The players must go to the real table to retrieve the physical puzzle.
*   **Lyrical Riddle:** In a video, a fragment of the song plays with the lyric: *"...where five frogs wait for rain that never comes..."*. This directs the players to the frog medallions splash pad to find the next clue.
*   **Action Replication:** The video shows the brother tapping the lampposts with the Bergman, Fuller, and King quotes in that specific order. The players must replicate this sequence. The numbers on those lampposts (found on the yellow stickers) form the code for a lockbox.
*   **Visual Match:** The sister sends a video containing a close-up image of the dragonfly pattern from the ground border (or a close-up, blurry photo). It's within a song that says the number of dragonflies is the next number in the lockbox. The players must find the pattern in the park and count the number of dragonflies in one section to get that number (or a key number).
*   **Forced Perspective:** A video shows the singer looking through a "tunnel." The players must find the tunnel (e.g., a piece of playground equipment) and look through it from the same angle. The object they see framed in the distance is their next destination.

#### Puzzles Using the Dynamic/Changing Song Video
*   **Spot the Difference:** The sister sends a new version of the video, texting, "I just watched it again and... it's different. Something changed in the background. Can you spot it?" The new or altered object/person/location is the next clue.
*   **Lip-Reading the Ghost Lyrics:** The song cuts off earlier and earlier, but the video shows the brother continuing to sing. The sister asks the players to lip-read the now-silent words to recover the next line of the missing verse.
*   **The Glitching Object:** In the latest version of the video, an object in the background (e.g., the seesaw) appears pixelated or distorted. This "glitch" indicates the location of the next physical clue.
*   **Continuity Error as a Riddle:** The changing video creates a continuity error. A character is wearing a red hat in one version and a blue hat in the next. The sister texts, "He can't be in two places at once. The color change must be a code."
*   **Audio Ghosts:** As the song shortens, a new sound is faintly audible in the silence at the end of the video—a bell tolling, a train whistle, a specific bird call. This new sound points to the next location.
*   **Background as a Map:** A new, previously unseen location appears in the background of the video. The sister texts a screenshot, asking, "Where is this? If we can find this place, we can find him."

### Meta-Narrative & Unifying Puzzles

*   **The Assembled Verse:** Each of the 5-7 major puzzles in the game rewards the players with a single, evocative word (e.g., 'HOME', 'LISTEN', 'COURAGE', 'TOGETHER', 'FIND'). These are likely a combination of found words or constructed words throughout the game. At the finale, players realize if they string the words together in the order they found them, they have reconstructed the lost verse of the song.
*   **The Musical Key:** Instead of a word, each puzzle solution is a single letter representing a musical note (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). The final sequence of notes is sent to the sister, who plays it on a keyboard in a video, revealing it's the melody of the lost verse, which unlocks the final video.
*   **The Storytelling Object:** The first puzzle leads to a lockbox containing a small, empty bag. Each subsequent puzzle provides a small, symbolic object (a unique stone, a guitar pick, a colored ribbon) to place in the bag. In the end, the collection of objects is used to "tell the story" of the song and prove they followed the brother's path.
*   **The Cipher Key Collection:** Each major location provides one piece of a substitution cipher (e.g., Dana Park gives A=T, the first Square gives E=S, etc.). The players cannot decode the final, encrypted message from the brother until they have collected all the key fragments from their journey.

### 🎬 Motivation & Meaning: Why Are We Solving These Puzzles?

These ideas give context and narrative motivation for *why* the players are completing each task, integrating themes of mystery, memory, music, and emotional connection. Some are grounded in logic, others in emotion, and some in magical realism — all are ready to be dialed up or down depending on your villain arc, tone, and story beat.

    — Motivates personal clue-solving, using character lore or inside jokes.

*   **21. “Only When We’re Ready”**
    The next message won’t appear until *everyone* is involved — e.g. players must all press “HELP” at the call box, or hum the same melody together.
    — Great for collective moments, theatrical or ritualized unlocking.

*   **22. “The Sound Unlocks the Site”**
    The puzzle isn’t text — it’s tonal. *“The website only opens if you enter the right 4 notes. Can you figure out the melody?”*
    — Combines musical literacy with puzzle logic.

*   **23. “The Answer is in the Echo”**
    Something they say in the park is echoed back in a WhatsApp voice message from the sister. She says: *“That’s what he used to say. That’s the key.”*
    — Motivates voice recordings, call-and-response, or rhythm puzzles.

*   **24. “When the Light Blinks, It Begins”**
    A light on the emergency call box blinks red — then green — then red. The sister: *“That’s the code he used. You just saw the clue.”*
    — Encourages timed observation or Morse decoding.

*   **25. “The Poem Knows the Way”**
    They’re given a jumbled stanza. *“If you reorder this poem by emotional intensity, you’ll know where to go next.”*
    — Ties into quote signs, metaphor clues, and art-as-map puzzles.

*   **26. “The Two-Part Key”**
    The sister finds a locked file called "THE TRUTH." She says: *"It's a two-part key. I have the password, but he texted me that he hid the physical part—a key or an object—somewhere only a kid would look."*
    — Motivates the search for a specific physical item that has a digital counterpart.

*   **27. “A Test of Loyalty”**
    The suspicious bandmate refuses to talk, sending a text: *"Prove you're on our side. The brother and I had a favorite spot. Find it, and tell me the message we carved there."*
    — Motivates a puzzle that is explicitly a character-driven test, not just a clue hunt.

*   **28. “The Glitching Reality”**
    The disappearing song is causing reality to feel unstable. A video from the sister distorts, and for a second, an image of the park's water fountain appears in the static. She says: *"Did you see that? It's like your world is bleeding into mine. Please, go to the fountain. I think it's a clue."*
    — Motivates puzzles with a magical realism element, where the game world's logic is breaking.

*   **29. “The Shadow Path”**
    A clue from the brother's diary reads: *"When the sun makes the iron giant's shadow touch the sleeping frogs, the path will be revealed."*
    — Motivates a puzzle that is dependent on the time of day and the physical environment.

*   **30. “The Process of Elimination”**
    The sister has a list of three locations where the brother might be held captive. *"Each puzzle you solve,"* she explains, *"gives us a piece of information that proves one of these locations is wrong. We're narrowing the search."*
    — Motivates a series of puzzles that feel like a detective's investigation, eliminating possibilities.

*   **31. “The Family Code”**
    The sister recalls a simple code she and her brother used as kids, based on the layout of their childhood home. She sends a sketch, saying: *"He would map our house onto any new place. If the kitchen was the sunniest spot, then the kitchen in the park would be the open lawn. Find his 'bedroom' and you'll find his secret."*
    — Motivates a metaphorical mapping puzzle that is deeply personal to the characters.

*   **32. "Gaining a Shy Ally"**
    A talented but nervous bandmate is afraid to help. The sister says, *"They only respond to music. My brother wrote a melody and hid the notes as numbers across the park. If you can find the sequence and send it to me, I can play it for them. It might be the only way to get them to talk."*
    — Motivates a musical puzzle that is central to character development and advancing the plot.

*   **33. "Fighting the Erasure"**
    A video shows the viral song glitching as a verse literally fades away. The sister sends a panicked text: *"The song is being erased! The villain is destroying it! We have to find the words to restore it before it's gone for good. Each one you find holds it together a little longer."*
    — Creates a powerful sense of urgency and positions the players as the protectors of the song.

*   **34. "The Video is a Memory"**
    The sister theorizes that the video itself is a living memory of the performance. She says: *"The background keeps changing because someone is tampering with the memory of the song. The differences you spot are the clues to who is doing this and why."*
    — Frames the "Spot the Difference" mechanic with a compelling, magical realism motivation.

*   **35. "Unmasking the Lie"**
    With each new version of the video, a different person appears in the background, or a bandmate disappears. The sister says: *"Wait... in the first video, the drummer was there. Now he's gone, and the mentor is in his place. Was the mentor there all along? This video is a lie, and we have to uncover the truth."*
    — Motivates puzzles that involve tracking characters and uncovering deception over time.

*   **36. "The Song is Fighting Back"**
    After the players solve a major puzzle, the next video they receive has a verse *restored*, but the background visuals are now even more chaotic. The sister says: *"You did it! The verse is back! But the song is fighting back against its corruption, and it's showing us images of where the villain is hiding. We have to decode them!"*
    — Rewards players for their progress while raising the stakes and introducing a new puzzle.
