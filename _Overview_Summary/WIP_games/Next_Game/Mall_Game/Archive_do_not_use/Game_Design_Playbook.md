# Game Design Playbook: Principles from Lost Verse

*Based on successful gameplay from "The Lost Verse" game*

---

## What Players Loved

### 1. **Physical Puzzle Variety**
Players enjoyed having multiple tactile puzzle types:
- Word searches
- Mazes  
- Sudoku
- Lockbags and lockboxes (the satisfaction of opening things)
- Chocolate/candy rewards throughout
- Games within smartphones

**Principle**: Mix puzzle types to engage different thinking styles and keep energy varied.

### 2. **Real Place + AI Character Integration**
The magic moment: AI characters in videos interacting with real, physical locations that players could touch and visit, often as a hint to what they should do in that same location.

**Examples that worked:**
- Lex in video touching specific lampposts → players find those same lampposts
- Lex & Maya at liquor store next to real Ben & Jerry's freezer → players meet them there

**Principle**: Videos should show characters interacting with actual, visitable locations. Players should be able to replicate what they see in the video at the real place.

### 3. **Dwelling Time in One Location**
Players appreciated spending extended time in Dana Park solving multiple puzzles, rather than constantly moving.

**Principle**: Choose one primary location where players can settle in and solve 3-4 puzzles. This creates a sense of place and reduces fatigue from constant movement.

### 4. **Hidden-in-Plain-Sight Clues**
Signs, squares, sculptures, plaques, etc that players had walked past countless times became suddenly visible and meaningful when they needed to extract clues from them.

**Principle**: Use existing, permanent fixtures (signs, plaques, memorials, architectural elements) that players can discover rather than temporary props. These feel more magical when "activated" by the game.

### 5. **Letter Extraction Mechanics**
Players enjoyed the pattern of extracting letters from signs using number patterns (e.g., "5th word, 3rd letter") to spell words.

**Principle**: Letter extraction from existing text creates a satisfying "decoding" experience. The text should be permanent and visible, not game-specific.

## What Didn't Work: Length & Complexity

### The Problem
- **Target**: 2 hours
- **Actual**: Ran too long, requiring on-the-fly simplification to bring it to the sweet-spot timing of 90-min
- **Skipped elements**: Math puzzle for code 757, color-hunting for sudoku code

### The Solution: Simplified Beat Structure

**Rule**: **5 Core Mechanics = 5 Core Beats + 2 Bookend Beats = 7 Total Beats**

**Beat Structure:**
**Beat 1: Invitation** (Setup, pre-game - discovery of materials can be integrated here or in the first puzzle)
**Beat 2: Mechanic 1** (First puzzle type)
**Beat 3: Mechanic 2** (Second puzzle type)
**Beat 4: Mechanic 3** (Third puzzle type)
**Beat 5: Mechanic 4** (Fourth puzzle type)
**Beat 6: Mechanic 5** (Fifth puzzle type)
**Beat 7: Resolution** (Final reveal/celebration)

**Note**: In Lost Verse, we had 10 beats. The ideal is 7 beats total, with 5 playable mechanics. Physical materials will be optional in future games, as they may be formatted for phone instead of paper-based.

### One Video Per Mechanic Rule

**Principle**: Each core puzzle mechanic should unlock one video that reveals the next mechanic. This creates clear progression:
- Mechanic 1 → Video 1 → Mechanic 2 → Video 2 → Mechanic 3, etc.

**Exception**: Beginning and ending videos are separate as they don't have game mechanics incorporated (invitation video, celebration video).

**Total Video Count**: 7 videos maximum
- 1 invitation video (pre-game)
- 1 video per mechanic (5 videos)
- 1 final celebration video (optional)

## Core Design Principles for Future Games

### 1. **90-Minute Target**
- Design for 90 minutes of active gameplay
- Test and trim ruthlessly
- If a puzzle feels optional or can be simplified, simplify it
- Better to have 5 great puzzles than 8 good ones

### 2. **One Primary Location**
- Choose one main location where players spend 60-70% of their time
- This location should have multiple discoverable elements (signs, fixtures, landmarks)
- Players should feel like they're "learning" this place through play

### 3. **5 Core Mechanics Maximum**
- Each mechanic should feel distinct and different
- Examples: letter extraction, number patterns, word puzzles, spatial puzzles, code-breaking
- Don't repeat the same mechanic type twice

### 4. **Real-World Integration**
- Use permanent fixtures whenever possible (signs, plaques, architectural elements)
- 1-3 videos should show characters interacting with these real elements
- Players should be able to "follow" what they see in videos in 1-3 videos

### 5. **Progressive Revelation**
- Each solved puzzle unlocks one video
- Each video reveals the next puzzle/code/location/story beat
- Clear cause-and-effect chain: Solve → Video → Next Clue/story moves forward

### 6. **Lockbag/Lockbox Satisfaction**
- Players love opening things
- Use lockbags (locked with 3 or 4 digit-combination locks) contain real or virtual keys or puzzle materials / story beats / videos
- Use lockboxes (locked with key locks) contain real or virtual keys or puzzle materials / story beats / videos
- Include candy/chocolate rewards in lockboxes or something else exciting if all is virtual

### 7. **Hidden-in-Plain-Sight Magic**
- Choose locations with existing text/signs/numbers that players can discover
- These should be things people walk past daily without noticing
- The game "activates" these elements, making them suddenly meaningful

### 8. **Character-Driven Story**
- AI character (like Maya) guides via Telegram/text
- Character has emotional arc: worried → determined → relieved
- Character celebrates player successes genuinely
- Character provides hints when needed, but doesn't solve puzzles for players unless the players are exhausted and requesting to skip sections

## Beat Structure Template

### Beat 1: Invitation
- **Purpose**: Set up story, introduce character, invite players
- **Location**: Pre-game (at home or starting point)
- **Mechanic**: None (pure setup)
- **Video**: 1 invitation video & text / Telegram message 

### Beat 2-6: Core Mechanics (5 beats - Mechanics 1-5)
**Note**: Discovery of initial materials can be integrated into Beats 1 or 2
Each follows this pattern:
- **Purpose**: Solve one puzzle type (could be many puzzles in a beat, but of all the same type)
- **Location**: Primary location (or transition)
- **Mechanic**: One distinct puzzle type. If many puzzles in that type, messaging with Telegram to provide the next puzzle.
- **Video**: One video per solved mechanic (reveals next code/clue)
- **Reward**: Unlocks next lockbag/lockbox or reveals next puzzle

### Beat 7: Resolution
- **Purpose**: Final reveal, celebration, completion
- **Location**: Final location (often different from primary)
- **Video**: Final celebration video

## Checklist for New Game Design

**Before designing puzzles:**
- [ ] Target location identified with multiple discoverable elements
- [ ] Primary location chosen (where 60-70% of gameplay happens)
- [ ] 5 distinct puzzle mechanics planned
- [ ] 7 beats outlined (Invitation + 5 Mechanics + Resolution)
- [ ] 5-7 videos planned (1 per mechanic + bookends)

**During design:**
- [ ] Each mechanic uses real, permanent fixtures
- [ ] Videos show characters interacting with real locations
- [ ] Lockbags/lockboxes or similar virtual mechanics provide satisfying opening or solving moments
- [ ] Candy/chocolate rewards included or something virtually as exciting
- [ ] Character has clear emotional arc
- [ ] Total time estimate: 90 minutes

**Before playtesting:**
- [ ] Can any puzzles be simplified or removed?
- [ ] Is there a clear video → puzzle → video progression?
- [ ] Are all clues hidden-in-plain-sight (no temporary props)?
- [ ] Does the story make sense with 5 mechanics?

## What Makes It "Julie"

These principles align with your signature style:

- **Reality as Game Board**: Using real places and permanent fixtures
- **Progressive Revelation**: Each discovery unlocks the next
- **Emotional Stakes**: Character-driven story with genuine investment
- **Hidden Magic**: Making the ordinary extraordinary
- **Community Building**: Shared discovery and celebration
- **Tactile Satisfaction**: Physical puzzles, lockboxes, rewards (or virtual equivalents)

## Notes for Cambridgeside Galleria Game

**Considerations:**
- Indoor mall = controlled environment, weather-proof
- Multiple floors = vertical movement possibilities
- Store signs, directory boards, architectural elements = hidden-in-plain-sight opportunities
- Food court = natural ending location (like liquor store)
- Mall hours = time constraints to consider

**Questions to answer:**
- What are the 5 distinct mechanics?
- What permanent fixtures can be "activated"?
- Where is the primary location (one area where players spend most time)?
- How do videos integrate with real mall locations?
- What's the story that drives the 7 beats?
