## 1. The "Will Shortz" Collection (Wordplay & Lateral Thinking)

*Focus: Puns, rebuses, and connecting unrelated concepts.*

### **The "Literalist" Scavenger Hunt**
**Concept:** Players receive clues that describe stores using hyper-literal or punny definitions rather than names.
*   **Clue:** "Go to the place where the fruit is made of metal and glass." (Apple)
*   **Clue:** "Find the bird that represents an entire country." (American Eagle)
*   **Clue:** "Locate the container that holds the ocean." (Sephora - sounds like "Sea-phora" / or C-Side Bar "Sea-Side")
*   **Clue:** "Go to the place where the alphabet ends." (ZARA - starts with Z).
*   **Mechanic:** Players must identify the store, go there, and send a photo of the logo to confirm.

### **The Mall Rebus**
**Concept:** Players find objects/signs that represent syllables to build a phrase.
*   **Task:** "Build the phrase 'I SEE YOU'."
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Take a photo of an **Eye** (on a LensCrafters poster).
    2.  Take a photo of the letter **C** (from the C-Side Bar sign).
    3.  Take a photo of the letter **U** (from the Lululemon sign).
*   **Result:** Sending the three photos in order unlocks the next clue.

### **The "Common Thread" Riddle**
**Concept:** Players are sent to three seemingly random stores and must find the one specific thing they all have in common visually.
*   **Locations:** Go to *Lids*, *Foot Locker*, and *The Red Store*.
*   **Observation:** What color is dominant in all three logos? (Red).
*   **Code:** The number of letters in that color (R-E-D = 3).

## 2. The "Josh Wardle" Collection (Logic & Deduction)

*Focus: Elimination, patterns, and feedback loops.*

### **"Mall-dle" (Real-Life Wordle)**
**Concept:** The Guide Character has chosen a "Secret Store." Players have 5 guesses to find it.
*   **Mechanic:** Players text a store name. The Guide responds with "Wordle-style" feedback based on the store's physical location or attributes.
*   **Guess 1:** "Apple" -> Guide: "Wrong floor (Gray), Right wing (Green), Wrong category (Gray)."
*   **Guess 2:** "Sephora" -> Guide: "Right floor (Green), Right wing (Green), Wrong category (Gray)."
*   **Guess 3:** "Zara" -> Guide: "Correct!"

### **The "Logic Grid" of Tenants**
**Concept:** A classic logic puzzle overlaid on the physical mall directory.
*   **Clues:**
    1.  "The Secret Store is not next to a shoe store."
    2.  "The Secret Store is directly below a store that sells food."
    3.  "The Secret Store has exactly 4 letters."
*   **Task:** Players must physically walk the mall to verify neighbors (since directories might not show perfect adjacency) and eliminate options until only one remains.

### **The "Binary Floor" Code**
**Concept:** Using the up/down nature of the mall as a binary language.
*   **Clue:** A sequence of stores is listed: *Apple, TJ Maxx, Sephora, Foot Locker, Aldo.*
*   **Translation:**
    *   Apple (Level 1) = 0
    *   TJ Maxx (Level 2) = 1
    *   Sephora (Level 1) = 0
    *   Foot Locker (Level 2) = 1
    *   Aldo (Level 1) = 0
*   **Result:** 01010 (Binary for 10). The code is 10.

## 3. The "Amazing Race" Collection (Kinetic & Navigational)

*Focus: Movement, physical tasks, and perspective.*

### **The "Human Protractor"**
**Concept:** Measuring distance without standard tools.
*   **Task:** "How many 'pigeon steps' (heel-to-toe) does it take to walk from the entrance of the Apple Store to the entrance of Sephora?"
*   **Tolerance:** The lockbox accepts a range (e.g., 45-50 steps).
*   **Why it works:** It forces players to move slowly and deliberately, looking silly (fun!) while focusing intensely on the space.

### **The "Window Shopping" Budget**
**Concept:** A math challenge based on changing window displays.
*   **Task:** "You have exactly $150.00 virtual dollars. Find three items in the window of *T.J. Maxx* that add up to exactly $150.00 (or closest to it without going over)."
*   **Mechanic:** Players text the three prices.
*   **Note:** Requires a quick scout by the Game Master beforehand to ensure prices are visible, or use a store with fixed prices like a menu at the Food Court.

### **The "Perspective Shift" (Anamorphosis)**
**Concept:** Finding the specific spot where chaos aligns into order.
*   **Task:** "Stand exactly on the 'You Are Here' star on the Level 1 directory. Look up at the balcony of Level 2. Count the number of vertical railing bars between the 'Z' in Zara and the 'T' in TJ Maxx."
*   **Why it works:** It turns the architecture into the puzzle board.

### **The "Silent Disco" Navigation**
**Concept:** Following audio cues rather than visual ones.
*   **Mechanic:** Players wear headphones (or share a phone speaker). The Guide sends an audio file. It’s a recording of a walk through the mall.
*   **Audio:** *Footsteps... faint sound of water (CanalSide)... louder chatter... the sound of a blender (Smoothie shop)... silence... a specific song playing from a store.*
*   **Task:** "Retrace the path of the audio recording. What store is the person standing in front of when the recording ends?"

## 4. The "Dave Barry" Collection (Humor & Absurdity)

*Focus: Social daring, silly observations, and "I am not making this up."*

### **The "Mannequin Challenge"**
**Concept:** Mimicking the environment.
*   **Task:** "Find the most ridiculously posed mannequin in the mall. Recreate the pose exactly with your team. Take a photo."
*   **The Twist:** The clue isn't the pose. The clue is *what the mannequin is looking at*. "Follow the mannequin's gaze. What is the first word on the sign it is staring at?"

### **The "Bad Review" Hunt**
**Concept:** Using fictional (or curated) reviews to find a location.
*   **Clue:** "I gave this place 1 star because the water was too wet and the boats were too boat-y."
*   **Location:** Charles River Boat Company.
*   **Clue:** "5 Stars. I ate a cloud here."
*   **Location:** Beard Papa's (Cream puffs) or Far Out Ice Cream.

### **The "Wrong Way" Directory**
**Concept:** Giving directions that are technically correct but absurdly inefficient.
*   **Task:** "Go to the Main Entrance. Turn left. Walk until you see a picture of a burger. Turn 180 degrees. Walk backwards for 20 paces. Look left. What is the unit number of the store you are facing?"

## 5. The "National Treasure" Collection (Hidden History & Symbols)

*Focus: Treating the mall like a historical artifact.*

### **The "Ghost Store" Rubbing**
**Concept:** Finding physical textures.
*   **Task:** "Find the plaque for the 'CambridgeSide Tailoring' (G1). Place a piece of paper over the raised letters and do a pencil rubbing of the first letter." (If signs are raised).
*   **Alternative:** "Find the date established on the CambridgeSide plaque (if exists). If no date, find the maximum capacity number on the elevator plate."

### **The "Floor Is Lava" Maze**
**Concept:** Using the floor tile patterns.
*   **Task:** "At the CanalSide entrance, there is a pattern of light and dark tiles. You must walk from the door to the C-Side Bar stepping ONLY on light tiles. If you step on a dark tile, you must restart."
*   **The Clue:** The path forces them to walk in a shape (e.g., a letter 'S' or a number '8'). "What shape did you just walk?"

### **The "Reflection" Code**
**Concept:** Using mirrors and glass.
*   **Task:** "Go to the Sephora window. Look at the reflection of the store *across* the hall in the glass. Read the store name backwards in the reflection. The 3rd letter is your key."

## 6. The "Escape Room" Collection (Tactile & Interactive)

*Focus: Using physical objects in the environment.*

### **The "Receipt" Cipher**
**Concept:** Players find a "lost receipt" (provided in their starting lockbox/bag).
*   **Prop:** A fake receipt listing items like:
    *   1x Apple
    *   2x Panda (Pandora)
    *   1x Eagle (American Eagle)
*   **Task:** "Go to these stores. The receipt lists the quantity. Find the Unit Number of each store. Multiply the Unit Number by the Quantity. Sum them up for the code."

### **The "Color Swatch" Match**
**Concept:** Matching paint chips.
*   **Prop:** Players are given a physical paint chip (e.g., a specific shade of teal).
*   **Task:** "Find the store front that matches this exact color." (e.g., Tiffany's or a specific part of the Lululemon facade).
*   **Reward:** Once they send a photo confirming the match, they get the next clue.

## 7. The "Spycraft" Collection (Stealth & Observation)

*Focus: Blending in and covert operations.*

### **The "Dead Drop" Simulation**
**Concept:** Retrieving info without being "noticed."
*   **Task:** "A 'contact' (a specific poster or standee) is holding intel at the AMC Theater entrance (or similar). Walk past it casually. Do not stop. Record the 3-digit number in the bottom right corner of the poster."

### **The "Conversation" Eavesdrop**
**Concept:** Listening to a pre-recorded conversation (via link) that sounds like ambient mall noise.
*   **Audio:** Background noise, footsteps, then a voice says: *"I left the package under the sign that says 'Clearance'."*
*   **Task:** Find the store with a "Clearance" sign in the window right now. (Requires a quick scout to ensure one exists, or use a permanent sign like "Restrooms").
