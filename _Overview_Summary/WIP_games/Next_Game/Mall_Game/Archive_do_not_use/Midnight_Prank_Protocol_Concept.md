# The Midnight Prank Protocol - Game Concept & Design Ideas

*Working document for hook coherence and final puzzle brainstorming*

## A. Game Concept

### The Problem

Lex has been researching the mall's history for a new music video when he discovered something incredible: In the earlly 1980s, a legendary prankster named "The Foam Phantom"  and secretly rigged the entire building with an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine. The plan was to create the ultimate prank—10,000 gallons of pink foam erupting from fountains, planters, and hidden vents to turn the mall into a foam party.

The prank was never triggered... until now. While filming his music video and researching the mall's architecture, he accidentally activated the 40-year-old system. The machine is warming up, and in 60 minutes, the mall will be buried under mountains of pink foam. Lex is working on the technical side—trying to find the power source and control systems—but he needs help solving the Phantom's puzzles scattered throughout the mall to try to stop the eruption before it's too late.

### Your Mission

Maya is frantically texting for help. Lex accidentally triggered the prank and is working on the technical side—trying to access control systems and cut power. But the Phantom was a master puzzle-maker. He left clues scattered throughout the mall that need to be solved, and that's where you come in.

Maya is coordinating the puzzle-solving side while Lex handles the technical work. She's found videos and research from Lex's earlier work that show where to look. The Phantom left clues hidden in plain sight throughout the mall. Each puzzle reveals a word—pieces of a message the Phantom left behind. Share everything you discover with Maya over text as she pieces together the clues with you.

**Your journey is backwards:** To stop the prank, you must trace its path in reverse—from where it ends back to where it starts. Follow the clues, understand the Phantom's design, and find the source before it's too late. These words hold the key to stopping the prank, but only when you understand what they mean together.

## B. Game Mechanics & Super Puzzle

### The Five Mechanics (Beats 2-6)

#### Beat 1: Introduction to the game
Players message Maya and she provides backstory via video & short Telegram text with first question to move players into Beat 2.

- **Created With:** AI image & video generators, shared over Telegram Text: Julie to do

Each beat 2-6 reveals one word that forms part of the Phantom's abort phrase: **"FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE"**

#### Beat 2: Following Lex's Path (Word: "FOAM")
**Mechanic:** Spot the Difference
- **Setup:** Maya shares a video from Lex's research—Lex filming his music video, walking through the mall
- **Mall Action:** Players retrace Lex's footsteps to the same locations shown in video
- **Mobile Game:** Maya sends spot-the-difference images one at a time - players compare reality to photo and report differences. Maybe in each picture there is a missing or added letter, so 4 images, spelling FOAM one lettr at a time.
- **Differences Reveal:** "FOAM"
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows part of Rube Goldberg chain superimposed on mall location, foam visible in video
- **Word Collection:** Players share "FOAM" with Maya over Telegram Text
- **Created With:** AI image & video generators, shared over Telegram Text: Julie to do

#### Beat 3: Hidden Connections (Word: "PHANTOM")
**Mechanic:** Word Search Puzzle
- **Setup:** Maya explains they need to find stores with common themes
- **Mall Action:** Players identify stores matching criteria through Telegram exchange with Maya:
  - Stores that are fruit
  - Stores with royal names or imagery
  - Stores with script writing in their name
- **Store Answers:** Apple, Mango, Queenia, Pandora, The, Threading, Spa, Oriental Relaxation, Le, Boutique, Instyle, Joselin
- **Special Hint:** If players miss Pandora, Maya hints about royal imagery (crown on Pandora logo)
- **Mobile Game:** Maya shares link to word search puzzle after all stores identified
  - Word list visible on puzzle screen (all 12 store names)
  - Players find store names in grid
  - After all words found: Screen grays out most content, highlights remaining letters
  - Remaining letters spell: **"PHANTOM"**
- **Message Reveals:** The word **"PHANTOM"** (players share hidden message back with Maya)
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows another section of Rube Goldberg chain, foam flowing through different part of mall
- **Word Collection:** Players share "PHANTOM" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Julie creates store finding instructions, Kai creates word search browser game with gray-out mechanism for hidden message reveal

#### Beat 4: Decoding the Phantom's Clues (Word: "PRANK")
**Mechanic:** Planet Table Cipher
- **Setup:** Maya directs players to find Museum of Science planet table (obscure location on 2nd floor)
- **Mall Action:** Players find planet table, read planet distances and locations
- **Mobile Game:** Players share each planet distance correctly - Maya acts as cipher, giving letter associated with each discovery until word is spelled
- **Cipher Reveals:** The word **"PRANK"**
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows Rube Goldberg mechanism activating, foam building pressure
- **Word Collection:** Players share "PRANK" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Julie to create puzzle, as in what are the 5 questions and answers for Maya to have the conversation over Telegram Text

#### Beat 5: Playing Your Way to the Solution (Word: "ABORT")
**Mechanic:** Food Court Game + Unlock
- **Setup:** Maya directs players to food court
- **Mall Action:** Players choose and play a real game (cornhole, Connect 4, or Jenga), report winner, share photo
- **Maya's Response:** Funny/quirky response about the game result
- **Unlock:** This unlocks access to next puzzle (Maze puzzle)
- **Word Reveals within the Maze puzzle:** They read their way out of the puzzle to get the word **"ABORT"**. The maze may say something like "the next word The Foam Phantom is 'Abort'" - something like that. 
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows foam reaching critical point, Rube Goldberg chain nearly complete
- **Word Collection:** Players share "ABORT" with Maya over text
- **Created With:** Either Julie creates png of the puzzle for Maya to share in text for them to read their way out of the maze, or Kai creates in-browser game version where they trace with hands. Either would work, but has to be big enough on screen - I haven't played a maze game with hand in an app, so should discuss.

#### Beat 6: Tracing the Power Source (Word: "CODE")
**Mechanic:** Pipes Location -> Sudoku
- **Setup:** Maya explains they need to find where the prank starts
- **Acrostic Puzzle:** Directed to a set of pipes where they're told which letters to read (e.g. 3rd word, 4th letter), until they've read the final word
- **Mall Action:** Players navigate to pipes location to location following Maya's Telegram Text message instructions
- **Discovery:** This is the starting point of the Rube Goldberg machine - foam flows from here through mall to food court
- **Video Reveal:** Video goes through vents showing foam and pathway - players see the complete Rube Goldberg path
- **Word Reveals:** The word **"CODE"** (final word of the phrase)
- **Interim Success Video:** Shows complete Rube Goldberg chain, foam ready to explode
- **Word Collection:** Players share "CODE" with Maya over text and get the final sudoku in browser-game format
- **Sudoku:** They solve sudoku to get the 3-digit code to give to Maya
- **Created With:** Julie creates clues to read "CODE" and Kai creates in-browser game sudoku.

### Beat 7: The Super Puzzle 

**All 5 Words Collected:** "FOAM" "PHANTOM" "PRANK" "ABORT" "CODE"

**The Abort Phrase:** Players now have all pieces of the Phantom's safety phrase: **"FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE"**

- **Action:** Players share the complete phrase "FOAM PHANTOM PRANK ABORT CODE" plus the 3-digit Sudoku code with Maya
- **Maya's Response:** Confirms phrase is correct, explains this is the Phantom's safety code, shares it with Lex
- **Video Reveal:** Lex uses the phrase + code to deactivate the prank system at the control point he's been working on
- **Success:** Prank is stopped, foam machine powers down, mall is saved

#### Why This Works:
- **Coherent Hook:** All 5 words form a meaningful phrase - the Phantom's abort code
- **Progressive Discovery:** Words seem unrelated until final puzzle reveals they're a phrase
- **Sudoku Integration:** Sudoku provides the numeric component needed to activate the phrase
- **Satisfying Payoff:** Speaking/typing the phrase feels like using a magic password
- **Story Integration:** The Phantom built in a safety mechanism - players discover and use it
- **Emotional Arc:** From collecting random words to understanding they form a safety code to successfully using it
