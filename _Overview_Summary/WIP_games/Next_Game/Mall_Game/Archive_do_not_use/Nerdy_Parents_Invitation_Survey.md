### **Version A: Enthusiastic & Detailed**

We're excited to invite you and your kids to playtest an AI-powered adventure game at Cambridgeside Galleria! Julie Price (NPCC member and game designer extraordinaire) is creating an immersive puzzle-mystery experience designed specifically for families who love creative tech. The game will run for about an hour on **Sunday, December 7 at 2:00 PM**, with wiggle room if you're running late.

Here's what to expect: your family will be guided through the mall by an AI agent (via your phone) who will lead you through a mystery story complete with video clues, escape-room-style puzzles, and challenges that use the actual mall as your game board. Think treasure hunt meets interactive movie, designed for kids but fun enough that parents won't be bored! To make sure the puzzles hit the sweet spot for your family, we need to know the ages of kids attending—because what works for a 5-year-old is very different from what works for a 12-year-old. (Don't worry, we can accommodate mixed ages; we just need to know the range!)

If you're interested and available on December 7, please take 30 seconds to fill out this quick survey so we can design the most engaging experience possible. We'll send details closer to the date, and we can't wait to see you there!

### **Version B: Concise & Practical**

Calling all Nerdy Parents: we're inviting your family to playtest an AI-powered adventure game at Cambridgeside Galleria on **Sunday, December 7 at 2:00 PM**! The experience takes about an hour and involves solving escape-room-style puzzles, watching video clues, and unraveling a mystery—all guided by an AI agent on your phone who leads you through the mall.

To design puzzles that work for your kids, we need to know their ages (a 5-year-old and a 12-year-old need very different challenges, though we can accommodate mixed-age groups). If you're interested and available, please fill out this 30-second survey so we can tailor the game to your family. It's going to be a blast, and we'd love to have you join us!

### **Version C: Story-Forward & Playful**

Ever wanted your kids to experience an escape room, treasure hunt, and interactive movie rolled into one? Julie Price is creating an AI-powered mystery adventure at Cambridgeside Galleria, and we're inviting NPCC families to be the very first players! On **Sunday, December 7 at 2:00 PM**, your family will spend about an hour solving puzzles, watching video clues, and exploring the mall to crack a mystery—all guided by an AI agent texting you instructions and reacting to your discoveries in real time.

Here's where you come in: to make the puzzles fun and age-appropriate, we need to know how old your kids are. (A puzzle that delights a 6-year-old might bore a 12-year-old, and vice versa—though we can absolutely handle mixed ages!) If you're interested and available on December 7, please take 30 seconds to fill out this quick survey. We'll use your input to design the best possible experience, and we'll send full details as we get closer to game day. See you at the mall!

### **Version D: Ultra-Concise (If space is tight)**

NPCC families: join us for an AI-powered mystery game at Cambridgeside Galleria on **Sunday, December 7 at 2:00 PM**! Expect about an hour of escape-room-style puzzles, video clues, and a story that turns the mall into your game board—all guided by an AI agent on your phone. To design age-appropriate challenges, we need to know your kids' ages. If you're interested and available, please fill out this 30-second survey so we can create the best experience for your family!

## PART 2: Story Concept Options for Survey

*For Question 2: "Which story sounds most exciting to you?"*

*Each concept has 3 variations to choose from. Pick your favorite version of each!*

---

### **CONCEPT #1: The Hologram Zoo Breakout**

#### Version A (Character-Free)
The mall's new Augmented Reality Safari exhibit has malfunctioned, and digital animals have escaped into real stores! You have 60 minutes to track down the creatures (lions in the food court, penguins at the skating rink) before the system resets and deletes them forever.

#### Version B (Light Character)
A musician was filming a music video at the mall's AR Safari when the system glitched and released digital animals into real stores. His sister needs your help to recapture them (lions in the food court, penguins at the rink) before they're deleted forever in 60 minutes.

#### Version C (More Story)
The mall's cutting-edge AR exhibit malfunctioned during a video shoot, releasing holographic animals into the real world. Track down escaped creatures hiding in thematically perfect spots (penguins at the skating rink, lions near the food court) and solve puzzles to capture them before the system's 60-minute auto-reset deletes them permanently.

---

### **CONCEPT #2: The Great Toy Rebellion**

#### Version A (Character-Free)
A beloved childhood teddy bear was accidentally donated to the mall's charity bin, and the toys inside have organized a heist to rescue it! The toys are the brains (sending signals through posed dolls and radio sounds), but they need your help to be the "muscle" before the donation truck arrives in 60 minutes.

#### Version B (Light Character)
Someone accidentally donated their brother's childhood teddy bear, and the toys in the donation bin are alive and planning a rescue! They need human hands to complete the heist—you'll follow clues from the toys themselves to reunite the bear with its owner before the truck arrives.

#### Version C (More Story)
A cherished teddy bear ended up in the mall's donation bin by mistake, and the other toys have orchestrated an elaborate heist to save it. The toys are genius masterminds (communicating through posed positions and radio signals), but they need you to push buttons, open doors, and solve puzzles before the collection truck drives away in 60 minutes.

---

### **CONCEPT #3: The Midnight Prank Protocol**

#### Version A (Character-Free)
A legendary prankster from the 1980s built an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine into the mall's architecture—and it's just been accidentally reactivated! Follow old blueprints to find hidden "kill switches" in fountains and planters before a fancy gala tonight gets buried in 10,000 gallons of pink foam.

#### Version B (Light Character)
A musician researching the mall's history discovered old blueprints from a legendary 80s prankster—and accidentally triggered a decades-old foam-bomb machine! His sister is texting you for help: find the hidden kill switches throughout the mall before tonight's gala gets destroyed.

#### Version C (More Story)
Decades ago, a legendary prankster rigged the entire mall with a Rube Goldberg foam apocalypse that was never triggered—until now. Using old blueprints discovered by a local musician, you must race through the mall finding hidden switches in unexpected places before a fancy event tonight gets buried under mountains of pink foam.

## PART 4: Recommended Story Descriptions for Final Survey

*Based on clarity, excitement, and appropriate detail for parents who need to quickly choose*

**My recommendation: Use "Version B" (Light Character) for all three concepts.**

**Why:** 
- Gives just enough context (someone's sister needs help, someone accidentally donated something)
- Creates emotional stakes without requiring backstory
- Keeps descriptions to 1-2 sentences as requested
- Parents can quickly scan and choose

**Final Recommended Survey Options:**

---

**Option 1: The Hologram Zoo Breakout**  
A musician was filming a music video at the mall's AR Safari when the system glitched and released digital animals into real stores. His sister needs your help to recapture them (lions in the food court, penguins at the rink) before they're deleted forever in 60 minutes.

## Notes for Implementation

**For Wendy's Email:**
- Choose one invitation paragraph (I'd recommend **Version B** for conciseness or **Version C** for story appeal)
- Include the survey link prominently
- Wendy can add her personal touches and integrate with her standard newsletter format

**For Google Forms:**
- Use the "Version B" story descriptions for Question 2
- Keep survey to exactly these 3 questions for the "30-second" promise
- Set up email collection to allow follow-up

**Timeline:**
- Send survey ASAP to give parents time to respond
- Use responses to finalize story choice and puzzle difficulty by ~Nov 30
- Send detailed logistics email to confirmed families by ~Dec 1
