# Video Production Checklist - Mall Prank

*Detailed bullets for starting images and action shots for Nanobanana video creation*

## Beat 1: Introduction Video (Maya)

### Starting Image Bullets:

  - **Script:** "Lex was researching the mall for his music video when he found something incredible - and terrible. In the 1980s, a prankster called The Foam Phantom rigged the entire mall with a Rube Goldberg machine. It was supposed to be a prank - pink foam everywhere. But Lex accidentally activated it, and now... In 60 minutes, the mall will be buried under foam. Food will be inedible, clothes unbuyable, tech unusable. Lex is working on the technical side, but the Phantom was a master puzzle-maker. He left clues scattered throughout the mall. Each puzzle reveals a word - pieces of a message. Can you help us solve them before it's too late?"
  - **Visual inserts (can be cut in or shown in background):**

- **Lip syncing:** Beat 1 (Maya) and Beat 7 (Lex) have dialogue; all others are visual only
- **Mall photos:** Use actual Cambridgeside Galleria photos you have for location backgrounds
- **Superimposition:** Rube Goldberg mechanisms are superimposed on mall locations
- **Progressive tension:** Each video shows more chain, more foam, more urgency
- **80s aesthetic:** Keep Rube Goldberg mechanisms retro and playful
