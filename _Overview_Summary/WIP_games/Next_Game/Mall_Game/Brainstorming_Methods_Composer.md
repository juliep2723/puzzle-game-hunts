# Brainstorming Methods for Story Generation

*Methods to generate story ideas that drive the 7-beat structure*

## 17 Brainstorming Methods (Quick Scan)

### **Location-First Methods**

1. **Mall Archaeology** - What secrets/history is hidden in the mall? (Old storefronts, architectural details, directory boards, food court history)

2. **Fixture Inventory** - List all permanent fixtures → What story could each tell? (Store signs, directory boards, floor numbers, elevator buttons, food court menus, restroom signs, exit signs)

3. **Vertical Story** - How does the story change as players move between floors? (Ground → escalator → second floor → food court)

4. **Store-as-Character** - What if a store (or store employee) is the missing person/guide? (GameStop employee, food court vendor, security guard, mall walker)

5. **Hidden Passage** - What if there's a "secret" area players discover? (Service corridors, employee areas, rooftop access, basement storage)

---

### **Character-First Methods**

6. **Who's Missing?** - Who disappeared and why would kids care? (Friend, sibling, teacher, store employee, pet, character from a game/show)

7. **Guide Character** - Who's texting/guiding via Telegram? (Missing person's sibling, friend, parent, store manager, security guard, another kid)

8. **Emotional Stakes** - What emotional need drives the story? (Rescue, reunion, prevent disaster, solve mystery, restore something broken)

9. **Age-Appropriate Hero** - What can kids uniquely do that adults can't? (Fit in small spaces, notice details adults miss, access kid-friendly areas, understand kid culture)

10. **Villain/Obstacle** - What's preventing success? (Time limit, person blocking them, missing information, broken thing, misunderstanding)

---

### **Mechanic-First Methods**

11. **Puzzle-to-Story** - Start with 5 puzzle types → What story needs these? (Letter extraction → decoding message; Maze → finding path; Sudoku → unlocking code)

12. **Video Integration** - What would characters do in mall videos? (Point at store signs, touch directory boards, stand by specific stores, interact with fixtures)

13. **Progressive Reveal** - What gets revealed in each beat? (Beat 2: Something's wrong; Beat 3: Missing person; Beat 4: Why they're missing; Beat 5: How to find them; Beat 6: Final clue; Beat 7: Resolution)

14. **Beat-by-Beat Tension** - How does urgency increase? (Beat 2: Curious; Beat 3: Worried; Beat 4: Urgent; Beat 5: Critical; Beat 6: Race against time; Beat 7: Success)

---

### **Story Structure Methods**

15. **Reverse Engineering** - Start with ending → What led here? (Food court celebration → What were they celebrating? → What problem was solved? → What clues led to solution?)

16. **Mall-as-Metaphor** - What does the mall represent? (Community, consumerism, connection, escape, routine, adventure hidden in ordinary)

17. **Time Pressure** - What deadline creates urgency? (Mall closing, event starting, person leaving, something breaking, opportunity expiring)

## Detailed Method Explanations

### **Method 1: Location-First Deep Dive**

**Process:**
1. Visit mall (or use photos/memory) → List every permanent fixture
2. For each fixture, ask: "What story could this tell?"
3. Group fixtures by location (food court, directory area, storefronts, etc.)
4. Identify which location has most "story potential" → This becomes primary location

**Example Questions:**
- What if directory boards hide a code?
- What if store signs spell something when read in order?
- What if floor numbers reveal coordinates?
- What if food court menus contain hidden messages?

### **Method 2: Character Arc Mapping**

**Process:**
1. Define guide character's emotional state at start (worried, confused, excited, determined)
2. Map emotional arc across 7 beats
3. For each beat, ask: "What discovery changes their emotion?"
4. Ensure each video shows character's emotional state

**Template:**
- Beat 1: [Emotion] - [Why]
- Beat 2: [Emotion] - [Discovery that changes it]
- Beat 3: [Emotion] - [Discovery that changes it]
- Beat 4: [Emotion] - [Discovery that changes it]
- Beat 5: [Emotion] - [Discovery that changes it]
- Beat 6: [Emotion] - [Discovery that changes it]
- Beat 7: [Emotion] - [Final resolution]

### **Method 3: Puzzle-to-Story Bridge**

**Process:**
1. List 5 puzzle mechanics you want to use
2. For each mechanic, ask: "What story problem does this solve?"
3. Connect mechanics: "How does solving Mechanic 1 lead to needing Mechanic 2?"
4. Build story around puzzle progression

**Example:**
- Letter extraction → Decoding a message → Who sent it? Why?
- Number patterns → Unlocking a code → What's locked? Why?
- Word search → Finding hidden words → What do they spell? What does it mean?
- Maze → Finding correct path → Where does it lead? Why is it hidden?
- Sudoku → Final code → What does this unlock? What's the final reveal?

### **Method 4: Beat Structure Fill-In**

**Process:**
1. Use beat template as worksheet
2. For each beat, brainstorm 3-5 story options
3. Mix and match until one story flows through all beats
4. Test: "Does each beat reveal something new? Does tension increase?"

**Template:**
```
Beat 1: Invitation
- Option A: [Story idea]
- Option B: [Story idea]
- Option C: [Story idea]

Beat 2: Mechanic 1
- Option A: [Story idea]
- Option B: [Story idea]
- Option C: [Story idea]

[Repeat for all 7 beats]
```

### **Method 5: "What If" Cascade**

**Process:**
1. Start with one "What if?" about the mall
2. Ask "What if?" 5 more times, each building on the previous
3. Use final "What if?" as story seed
4. Map to 7 beats

**Example:**
- What if the mall directory boards are hiding something?
- What if they're hiding a code?
- What if the code unlocks something important?
- What if it unlocks information about a missing person?
- What if the missing person left clues in the mall?
- What if kids need to follow those clues to find them?

### **Method 6: Constraint-Based Brainstorming**

**Process:**
1. List constraints (mall setting, 90 min, 5 mechanics, 7 beats, kids as players)
2. For each constraint, brainstorm how to use it as advantage
3. Combine constraint advantages into story

**Constraints → Advantages:**
- Mall = Controlled environment → No weather issues, predictable fixtures
- 90 min = Time pressure → Natural urgency
- 5 mechanics = 5 discoveries → Progressive revelation
- Kids = Unique perspective → Notice things adults miss

## Quick Brainstorming Session Format

### **15-Minute Rapid Fire**

3. **5 min**: Story seeds (one sentence per idea, 10-15 ideas)

### **30-Minute Deep Dive**

1. **10 min**: Choose top 3 story seeds from rapid fire
2. **10 min**: Map each seed to 7-beat structure
3. **10 min**: Identify which seed has strongest beat progression

### **60-Minute Full Development**

1. **15 min**: Rapid fire session
2. **15 min**: Deep dive on top seed
3. **15 min**: Fill in beat details
4. **15 min**: Test story flow and identify gaps

## Story Evaluation Checklist

After brainstorming, evaluate each story idea:

- [ ] Does it use real mall fixtures?
- [ ] Can it drive 7 beats with increasing tension?
- [ ] Does it allow 1-3 videos showing characters at real locations?
- [ ] Is it age-appropriate and engaging for kids?
- [ ] Does it create emotional investment?
- [ ] Can it be completed in 90 minutes?
- [ ] Does it have a satisfying resolution?
- [ ] Does it make the mall feel magical/meaningful?

## Combining Methods

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Start with **Location-First** (inventory mall fixtures)
2. Use **Character-First** (who's missing/guiding)
3. Apply **Beat Structure Fill-In** (map story to 7 beats)
4. Use **Puzzle-to-Story Bridge** (connect mechanics to story)
5. Test with **Story Evaluation Checklist**

*Use these methods individually or combine them to generate story ideas that naturally fit your 7-beat structure and mall setting.*
