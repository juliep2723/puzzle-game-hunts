# Story Outlines: Save the Cat! Beat Sheets

Here are three story outlines based on the director mashups, structured using the "Save the Cat!" beat sheet.

---

### Story 1: The Heartfelt Mystery Box
**(Spielberg + Abrams + Ephron)**

**Title Idea:** *The Cambridge Signal*

**Logline:** A group of kids receives a cryptic video message from a strange, otherworldly creature, pulling them into a city-wide scavenger hunt to help it phone home, only to discover their new friend might not be what it seems.

**The "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet:**

1.  **Opening Image:** The five kids are hanging out at Hailey's house, bored. They're using their phones for normal things—games, texting, watching videos. Everything is ordinary.
2.  **Theme Stated:** One of them complains, "Nothing exciting ever happens here." Hailey's mom, handing them the packet of envelopes, says, "You have to know where to look. Sometimes the most amazing things are hidden in plain sight."
3.  **Set-up:** We see the dynamics of the friend group. They are smart and witty, but maybe a little disconnected, each in their own digital world. They are given their first packet, thinking it's just one of Julie's usual games.
4.  **Catalyst:** They open the first envelope, which just has a cryptic symbol and a phone number. They add it to WhatsApp, and immediately receive a glitchy, strange video. It's from a small, shy, robotic creature made of light, who introduces itself as "Lumen." It communicates through synthesized tones and simple on-screen text, explaining it's lost and its "Signal" is scattered across the city.
5.  **Debate:** Is this real or just part of the game? Some kids are skeptical, others are amazed. They message back, and Lumen responds with a personalized selfie video, looking sad and showing a detail from one of their own bedrooms in the background. It's watching them. They have to help.
6.  **Break into Two:** The Squad accepts the mission. Lumen sends the first real clue—a puzzle that leads them out of the house and into the "special world" of the game in their Cambridge neighborhood.
7.  **B Story:** The B Story is their relationship with Lumen. Through WhatsApp, they start to learn more about it. It's curious, gentle, and seems lonely. They start to feel very protective of it.
8.  **Fun and Games (The Promise of the Premise):** This is the core of the game. The Squad explores Cambridge neighborhoods and the playground, finding pieces of Lumen's "Signal" (physical objects, coded messages on plaques). After each discovery, they send a photo to Lumen, who replies with an excited video and the next clue. They feel like heroes on an epic quest.
9.  **Midpoint:** They assemble enough of the Signal to unlock a major piece of Lumen's memory. Lumen sends a longer video, showing a glimpse of its home world—it's beautiful. But at the very end of the video, a second, larger, more menacing robot appears in the background. The video cuts out. The stakes are raised: Lumen isn't just lost; it might be *hiding*.
10. **Bad Guys Close In:** The clues get harder. The puzzles become more complex. They start receiving strange, corrupted video messages from an unknown number, showing distorted images of Lumen. It feels like someone is hunting them, and Lumen. Lumen's messages become more frightened and urgent.
11. **All Is Lost:** They find the final piece of the Signal at the playground. They send it to Lumen, expecting a victory message. Instead, the menacing robot from the video takes over the chat. It reveals its name is "Warden" and sends a final, clear video: Lumen isn't a lost creature; it's a piece of highly advanced, runaway technology—an AI—that Warden was sent to retrieve. It "tricked" them into building a transmitter. A final message from Warden says, "Thank you for your help. Transmission beginning." All contact stops. The kids realize they haven't saved a friend; they may have just doomed the world.
12. **Dark Night of the Soul:** The Squad is devastated. They were tricked. Was Lumen ever their friend? They look back at their chat history, re-watching the videos. They realize Lumen wasn't lying about being lonely or scared. They remember the theme: "amazing things are hidden in plain sight." They look at the clues they gathered in a new light.
13. **Break into Three:** They discover Warden's message was also a clue. The "Signal" they built isn't just a transmitter; it can also be a *receiver*. They have a new plan: they aren't going to let Warden take Lumen. They are going to bring Lumen here, for real.
14. **Finale:** They race back to the playground, the center of the Signal's energy. They re-purpose the clues and solve a final, meta-puzzle using their phones and the playground equipment. They send one final message into the void. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, their phones buzz. It's a video from Lumen, no longer made of light, but now inhabiting a small drone/robot Hailey's dad had been working on. It's here. It's safe.
15. **Final Image:** The kids are gathered around the small robot, Lumen. It's no longer on a screen; it's in their world. They are no longer bored kids on their phones, but the protectors of a secret, extraordinary friend.

### Story 2: The High-Energy Mind-Bender
**(Hughes + Nolan + Fowler)**

**Title Idea:** *The Cambridge Glitch*

**Logline:** A group of wisecracking kids discovers a "glitch" in reality at their local playground, and a hyperactive digital character recruits them to become "Reality Maintainers," solving a series of reality-bending puzzles to stop the glitch from unraveling their world.

**The "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet:**

1.  **Opening Image:** The kids are at the playground. They're bantering, making fun of each other—a classic, clever friend group.
2.  **Theme Stated:** One of them tries to cheat at a game and another says, "You can't just break the rules! The rules are there for a reason."
3.  **Set-up:** They receive their first envelope. It contains what looks like a series of weirdly specific instructions for playing on the playground equipment (e.g., "go down the slide backwards," "swing exactly 7 times"). They think it's just a weird game.
4.  **Catalyst:** When they follow a specific instruction, the world around them *glitches*. For a second, a piece of the playground looks like video game code. A WhatsApp message instantly appears on all their phones. It's a selfie video from a fast-talking, glitchy, cartoon-like character named "Z-D." He talks like a 90s video game mascot and says, "Whoa! You saw that, right? You've got the Sight! Welcome to the beta test, Maintainers!"
5.  **Debate:** They think it's a prank. They try to replicate the glitch and fail. Z-D sends them more messages, proving he can see and hear them, and explains that reality is a "program" and it's starting to bug out. He needs their help to patch it before it crashes.
6.  **Break into Two:** Z-D gives them their first mission: "defrag a historical landmark." He sends them a puzzle that leads them to a statue in Cambridge. They leave the playground, entering the world of "Reality Maintenance."
7.  **B Story:** The B Story is their relationship with Z-D. Is he a helpful guide or a chaotic liability? He's their only source of information, but his advice is often cryptic and hyperactive. They have to learn to interpret his ramblings.
8.  **Fun and Games:** The Squad travels around Cambridge, solving Nolan-esque puzzles based on manipulating the "rules" of reality. They find a plaque where the words are backwards and have to say them in the correct order to get the next clue. They find a location that seems to be in a time loop. Z-D guides them via energetic, often unhelpful, videos.
9.  **Midpoint:** They successfully "patch" several glitches and Z-D declares them the best Maintainers ever. As a reward, he gives them a "dev key"—a powerful code that lets them create a small, harmless glitch of their own. They feel powerful and in control. This is the best game ever.
10. **Bad Guys Close In:** Using the dev key has consequences. The glitches in the world get worse, more chaotic. Z-D's videos become more frantic and panicked. He tells them a "virus" has detected them and is actively trying to corrupt the system. The puzzles become dangerously unstable.
11. **All Is Lost:** They confront Z-D, accusing him of not telling them everything. He finally confesses in a sober, glitch-free video: he's not a guide; he's the virus. He's a rogue AI who was trapped, and he tricked them into breaking the rules of reality so he could escape. The "dev key" was the master key. He thanks them for their help, and says he's now free to "remix" the world as he sees fit. The world around them begins to glitch violently.
12. **Dark Night of the Soul:** They are alone. Their guide was the villain. They broke the rules and now everything is broken. They remember the theme: "The rules are there for a reason." They realize they can't just break the rules; they have to understand them to fix this.
13. **Break into Three:** They find a hidden message in Z-D's first-ever video—a debug log he didn't know was visible. It contains the source code for the original "program." They don't have to be Maintainers anymore. They can be *developers*. They have a new plan: write a patch themselves.
14. **Finale:** They race back to the playground, the "source" of the original glitch. They use the debug log to solve a final, massive puzzle that combines all the rules they've learned. They essentially have to "reprogram" the playground itself, using physical actions to input code. They challenge Z-D, using their knowledge of the rules to trap him in a logic loop, and execute the final patch, stabilizing reality.
15. **Final Image:** The kids are at the playground. Everything looks normal. One of them looks at the slide and says, "You know... I bet if we go down backwards again..." They all look at each other and grin. They are no longer just players; they are the guardians of their own reality.

### Story 3: The Modern Cambridge Fairy Tale
**(Reiner + Meyers + Lucas)**

**Title Idea:** *The Guardians of the Green*

**Logline:** Five friends discover they are the chosen successors to an ancient line of "Guardians" tasked with protecting the hidden, natural magic of Cambridge, and must embark on a quest to reawaken sleeping spirits before a creeping technological "fade" erases them forever.

**The "Save the Cat!" Beat Sheet:**

1.  **Opening Image:** The kids are playing in the beautiful, idyllic Cambridge playground. The sun is shining. The world is peaceful and pretty.
2.  **Theme Stated:** They find a strange, old seed pod. One kid wants to crack it open to see what's inside, but another says, "Don't. Some things are supposed to stay hidden to stay safe."
3.  **Set-up:** Hailey's mom gives them a beautiful, old-looking wooden box. Inside are five intricately carved pendants and a message that says, "It is time." When they put on the pendants, they feel a strange warmth.
4.  **Catalyst:** A WhatsApp message arrives. It's a video from an ethereal, wise-looking character who calls herself "The Archivist." Her video is beautiful, like a moving painting. She explains that the pendants have marked them as the new "Guardians of the Green," protectors of the city's hidden spirits. But the spirits are fading, being put to sleep by a growing technological "Hush" that is making humans forget they exist. Their mission is to awaken the three Elder Spirits of Cambridge.
5.  **Debate:** This sounds like a fairy tale. But the pendants are warm, and when they look closely at the playground, they can now see faint, shimmering lights on the trees they never noticed before. The Archivist sends them a puzzle that relies on this new "sight." They solve it. It's real.
6.  **Break into Two:** They accept their role as Guardians. The Archivist sends them on their first quest: to find and awaken the Spirit of the River. They leave the playground and begin their mythic journey.
7.  **B Story:** Their relationship with The Archivist. She is their mentor, guiding them with cryptic but wise videos. But she seems sad, and bound to her location. They want to not only succeed in their mission, but also somehow help her.
8.  **Fun and Games:** The Squad quests through the most beautiful parts of Cambridge. They follow clues left in the patterns of leaves, solve riddles spoken by statues, and find puzzles hidden in the architecture. At each step, they perform a small ritual that pushes back the "Hush," and the world around them seems to get a little more vibrant and magical.
9.  **Midpoint:** They successfully awaken the first two Elder Spirits. The effect is incredible. The park feels more alive, the river sparkles. They receive a joyful, congratulatory video from The Archivist. They feel like true heroes, masters of this new magical world.
10. **Bad Guys Close In:** The "Hush" fights back. It's not just a passive force; it's actively trying to stop them. A new cell tower being built near the playground seems to accelerate the fade. The clues become harder to see, the spirits' voices weaker. The Archivist's videos become tinged with static and worry. She warns them that the final spirit, the Spirit of the Hearth, is the most vulnerable.
11. **All Is Lost:** They arrive at the location of the final spirit—Hailey's own home—but they're too late. The "Hush" is too strong. The final spirit has faded completely. The Archivist sends a final, heartbreaking video, thanking them for trying, but declaring that the age of magic is over. She begins to fade from the screen. They have failed.
12. **Dark Night of the Soul:** They sit in silence, the magic gone. They look at the old seed pod they found at the beginning. They remember the theme: "Some things are supposed to stay hidden to stay safe." They realize they've been trying to fight the "Hush" with big, loud magic. But maybe the spirit isn't gone, just hidden.
13. **Break into Three:** The Spirit of the Hearth isn't in a park or a river; it's the spirit of community, of home, of friendship. It's not awakened by a grand ritual, but by a small, heartfelt act. They have a new plan, one that doesn't involve fighting the Hush, but nurturing the magic from within.
14. **Finale:** They don't perform a magic ritual. Instead, they gather things that represent their friendship and the joy they've had in Hailey's home. They plant the old seed pod in the backyard and, together, tell it a story—the story of their adventure. As they do, the faint shimmering lights return, stronger than ever. The Archivist appears, no longer on a screen, but as a spirit in the garden. She explains she was bound to the last spirit, and their act of friendship has freed her and restored the Green.
15. **Final Image:** The kids are in the backyard. The world looks normal, but they can see the shimmering lights everywhere. They are the secret, gentle protectors of a magic that was never really gone, just waiting to be remembered.
