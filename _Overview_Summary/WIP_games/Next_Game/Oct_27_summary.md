**Working Title:** *The Lost Verse*
**Premise:**
The players are contacted by a young woman searching for her missing brother — a street musician whose song went viral the night before he vanished. The song is unfinished — it’s missing a final verse. And something about that missing verse is… wrong. And as the game wears on, the video of the song loses more and more verses. The song itself is disappearing.

It's also strange that the brother performed this song without his bandmates, which he never does.

She believes the song holds extraordinary power — maybe even the power to heal, restore, or change the world — but something has disrupted that power. The kids must help her find her brother, uncover what the song was meant to do, and restore the missing verse before it’s too late.

This is a two-hour, immersive, cinematic puzzle game that unfolds through real-time messaging, location-based clues, and a developing story told through **video, text, and music**.

## 💬 Gameplay Framework

The experience unfolds through **WhatsApp**, where the players communicate with **NPCs (non-player characters)** through a mix of text, video, and images.

There are **two parallel worlds** operating at once:

1. **The NPCs’ world** – the sister, the missing brother’s bandmates, and whoever else is part of the mystery.
2. **The players’ world** – the real, physical world of Cambridge, where clues are hidden in plain sight: parks, playgrounds, plaques, street art, signs, etc.

The bridge between the two is **WhatsApp** — a digital portal that lets the two worlds communicate and affect each other.

### 🧩 Puzzle Mechanics & Real-World Integration

While the story unfolds through digital messages and cinematic videos, the heart of *The Lost Verse* lies in **hands-on discovery.**

Throughout the game, players will find **physical puzzles** hidden in real locations — under benches, taped behind signs, tucked beneath landmarks, or subtly placed within the playground. These clues might appear ordinary at first (a sudoku, a word search, a maze, a coded message), but each conceals a deeper layer connected to the missing song.

The **narrative logic** is that the brother — knowing his song was dangerous and being pursued — left behind **coded breadcrumbs** only people outside the music industry would recognize. He hid them where only curious, courageous kids could find them. His sister can’t follow them herself; she’s being watched or tracked, but she can guide the players safely from afar.

Each puzzle requires either a **paper clue**, a **a real-world object or marker** (e.g., a lamppost number, plaque date, sign lettering), or **both** to find or decrypt a message. The result might be:

* a **3-digit code** to open a real lockbox,
* a **bit.ly or QR code** leading to a new video,
* a **lyrical phrase or number sequence** that advances the story.
* a **photo** of something specific in their environment

This system keeps the gameplay tactile and immersive, making players feel like real-world agents decoding a live mystery.

## 📱 How Communication Works

### 1. Cinematic Video Updates (Landscape format)

The sister sends **short, movie-like videos** showing what has happened since the last mission — she might be in her brother’s apartment, a recording studio, or meeting one of his bandmates. The location could also be at an outdoor park or landmark that our game players must also be at to find a clue or solve a puzzle.

* These are cinematic scenes — filmed, edited, scored.
* They carry emotion, suspense, and story development.
* Each video ends with a *mystery or question* the players must help solve.

### 2. Direct-to-Player Videos (Portrait format)

The sister speaks directly to the players — raw, emotional, immediate.

* She looks into the camera as if FaceTiming them.
* These clips make the players feel *seen and essential.*
* She might hold up objects or show other people behind her.
* The location could also be at an outdoor park or landmark that our game players must also be at to find a clue or solve a puzzle.

### 3. Text-Based Clues and Requests

She sends texts asking for help, new discoveries, or player input. They may also find paper-based clues they need to solve either just on paper, or using extra information from their surroundings together to solve important riddles, clues, problems, etc.

* Example: “He left a clue within the plaque near the park he used to play in. Can you check it? Send me a photo of it when you find it and I'll tell you how to find the clue”
* Players reply with text or photos to report their findings. She will give hints at ciphers or explain patterns for decoding messages, or provide instructions to help get the clue necessary to unlock something, find a hidden message, or move game-play forward

### 4. Reactive Messaging

In some cases, these messages will direct the players to search for **physical clues** left by the missing brother — coded notes, puzzles, or secret lockboxes hidden in their environment. The sister explains that the brother designed this “Musician's Trail” to protect his work, so the players are the only ones who can safely find and solve them. Each physical solve connects back to a digital reveal (a new message, song fragment, or hidden video). 

---

## 🧩 Gameplay Loop

Each major beat follows this rhythm:

1. **Receive a cinematic video** (the story advances).
2. **Get a direct message or portrait video** (the sister asks for help).
3. **Search, solve, and respond** (players find clues in their world).
4. **Trigger the next reveal** (a new video or message unlocks).

This loop keeps the players emotionally engaged, constantly alternating between *story consumption* and *story participation.*

## 🎭 Characters

**1. The Sister (Main Contact / Guide)**

* Empathetic, determined, a little overwhelmed.
* The players’ emotional anchor — their guide, their heart.

**2. The Brother (The Musician)**

* Seen in the original viral video, flashbacks and found-footage clips.
* Charismatic, passionate, mysterious.
* His disappearance is the driving mystery.
* Before vanishing, he left **a coded trail of clues** — analog puzzles and ciphered notes — hidden in everyday places. These are part confession, part protection plan. The players must follow his trail to uncover both the truth and his location.

**3. The Bandmates**

* A mix of personalities and motives.
* Some helpful, some hiding secrets.
* At least one becomes central to the conflict — a “villain” with a reason that makes emotional sense. One will be the false villain, who we suspect is the villain until we realize it as a red herring.

**4. Possible Antagonist (The Villain or Force)**

* Could be a rival artist, producer, a jealous bandmate, a bandmate who teamed up with a villain or "evil sociaety", or someone who misused the song’s power.
* The tone is clever, not dark — someone who believes they’re right, even if they’re wrong.

---

## 🎶 The Song Itself

The song is the **heart of the story**. It has:

* A melody that’s haunting, beautiful, and strangely familiar. (think K-pop Demon Hunters)
* Lyrics that carry *truths about connection and belonging.*
* A missing final verse that contains the “life equation” — something that balances creation and destruction OR has the secret to belonging and finding life's harmony, which someone does not want to get out.

The song’s power might be linked to:

* something deeper, but we don't know what, just yet.

When the verse is broken, the truth becomes further away and harder for us to grasp — relationships strain, anger creeps in, and it will only get worse...

The players’ mission is to **find the missing verse, restoring the song and the truth**, **save the brother**, and **restore harmony** before the song disappears for good.

## 🧠 Story Structure

The story will follow the **Save the Cat** beat model, adapted for a two-hour, immersive format.
Key beats will include:

* **Opening Image:** The viral song / missing musician.
* **Catalyst:** The sister reaches out.
* **Break into Two:** The players join the search.
* **Fun & Games:** The players begin finding the brother’s hidden puzzles — physical and digital breadcrumbs that combine logic, lyrics, and real-world observation. Each solve recovers a fragment of the song or reveals a truth about the brother’s bandmates.
* **Midpoint:** They believe they’ve found the villain — a bandmate framed by the clues — but it’s a red herring.
* **Bad Guys Close In:** One bandmate turns, the sister is in danger, yada yada yada.
* **Finale:** The kids assemble the full verse, send it back, and restore harmony.
* **Final Image:** The brother’s return — or the sister finishing his song.

We’ll map this structure collaboratively once all story questions are answered.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

This game inherits the spirit of all the previous ones:

| From Julie’s 52nd                | From K-Pop Demon Hunters                         | From Our Directors                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Real-world, grounded mystery.    | Teamwork, courage, emotion-as-power.             | Spielberg heart, Abrams tension, Ephron wit.  |
| Emotional resonance > spectacle. | Stylish, character-driven action.                | Dialogue and visuals that feel cinematic.     |
| Puzzles that *mean* something.   | Characters learning who they are through crisis. | A story that could be a film — but is a game. |

---

## 💡 What We’ll Build Together

With this foundation, we’ll:

1. Finalize **the core story questions** (mystery, song, characters, stakes).
2. Build the **Save the Cat beat sheet**.
3. Outline the **two-hour structure** (scene-by-scene with their puzzles / quests / mysteries flow).
4. Create **placeholders for the clues and puzzles** to make sure the rest of the story holds. (Sometimes in designing the clues and puzzles, we evolve storyline based on either new ideas or the reality of what puzzles can be worked in, so we draft them to give us the chance to iterate against the outline, first.)
5. Develop **video scripts**, **WhatsApp messaging arcs**
6. Create the **musical core** — the actual “lost song.”
7. Design the **physical puzzle set** — tactile, solvable clues that connect in-story to the brother’s hidden trail (lockboxes, paper puzzles, ciphered notes).

## 🪄 Summary

> *The Lost Verse* is a story-driven, real-world adventure where kids use curiosity, empathy, and intellect to piece together a mystery that blurs the line between music and magic. It’s about creativity as courage and belonging — about the idea that when we finish the song together, we heal the world together.
